will assume stance when an enemy champion is in range of

cooldown will still be reduced.
This ability goes on cooldown on death and refreshes upon respawn.

The highlighted areas denote the sweetspot - enemies are affected where the two areas overlap (See
edge range
and
center range
).
The first and second casts function like any point-blank AOE (i.e. an effect centered on the caster). An enemy is considered to be hit by the ability based on
edge range
- i.e. if any part of your
gameplay radius
is within the hitbox, you are affected.
The third cast, as well as the
Sweetspot
for the first and second cast, function like
ground-targeted
abilities. An enemy is considered to be hit by the ability based on
center range
- i.e. an enemy's center has to be within the hitbox to be affected.
As implied by the previous point, the
Sweetspot
for the first and second cast is implemented as separate
areas of effect
to the main component of the ability. Enemies must be within both areas to trigger the bonus damage,
knock up
and
Deathbringer Stance's
cooldown reduction.
The 'target gets hit' SFX plays whenever an enemy is within the
Sweetspot
- meaning it is possible to trigger the sound effect without affecting an enemy.
Each cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as
Spellblade
and triggering
Force Pulse's
passive.
The hitbox and
Aatrox's
model are fixed to the initial target direction.
Aatrox's
facing-direction, for effects such as
Petrifying Gaze
, is the direction he is moving, and not the direction the model is facing.
All damage modifiers
stack multiplicatively
.
There's a small period of time in which Aatrox can't declare basic attacks after casting
The Darkin Blade
.

This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.

Once honored defenders of Shurima against the Void, Aatrox and his brethren would eventually become an even greater threat to Runeterra, and were defeated only by cunning mortal sorcery. But after centuries of imprisonment, Aatrox was the first to find freedom once more, corrupting and transforming those foolish enough to try and wield the magical weapon that contained his essence. Now, with stolen flesh, he walks Runeterra in a brutal approximation of his previous form, seeking an apocalyptic and long overdue vengeance.

Aatrox is a violent and notorious crime lord whose name is feared throughout the criminal underworld. He is also disfigured by Ora abuse. Seeking to purge the substance from his body, he abducts Templars to extract it—and kills them when they are unable to do so. He has seized a number of high ranking Templar priests in order to draw out Karma, who he believes will finally heal him.

Trivia
[
]
Aatrox, the Darkin Blade
Out-of-universe,
Aatrox
is a word play on Latin
atrox
"fierce, savage, cruel" in turn from
ater
"dull black, dark", from root
PIE
*h₂eh₁ter-
"fire";
[2]
All of these reference the
Darkin
weapon's physical manifestation and demonic nature (punning on
dark kin
), various
historical fire-based weapons
, the
scorched earth
strategy, and his '
war as an artform
' philosophy. Latin
atrox
gives rise to Anglo-French
atrocity.
Aatrox,
Dr. Mundo
,
Mordekaiser
,
Vladimir
, and
Zac
are the only champions that use their own
health
as a resource for
abilities
.
Enemies hit by
Massacre
will leave a blood trail between themselves and Aatrox that he will rapidly absorb (this is a remaining visual effect from PBE testing, where Aatrox would gain attack speed based on how many enemies had been hit by
Massacre
, that was recycled in
V5.6
).
Aatrox can still use emotes during
Blood Well's
revive.
Sterak's Gage
is speculated to have been
Aatrox's
missing left arm glove. Its passive was also coincidentally similar to Aatrox's.
Prior to his rework, on the statement "This champion needs an update", players ranked Aatrox 5th in NA; 4th in BR; 3rd in KR and 14th in CN. He ranked 4th overall.
[3]
Aatrox, the Darkin Blade
Aatrox is the first champion, since
Lulu's
patch
introduced champion specific
login screens
, to receive two login screens and themes released for his Classic skin.
In-game, Aatrox can toggle his banner-style wings and his sword stance [default: Ctrl + 5].
Aatrox
is one of 20 champions without a single
ability power
ratio on any ability:
Camille
,
Darius
,
Dr. Mundo
,
Draven
,
Garen
,
Kayn
,
Kled
,
Naafiri
,
Nilah
,
Olaf
,
Pyke
,
Riven
,
Samira
,
Sett
,
Talon
,
Urgot
,
Xayah
,
Yone
, and
Zed
.
The icon for
World Ender
is reused for the
Teamfight Tactics
item
Darkin
.
Aatrox's Series 1
Eternals
make the following references:
Chains Yanked
references the idiom
yank one's chain
as well as the pull of
Infernal Chains
.
QQ's
references the
QQ emoticon
as well the multi-cast nature of
The Darkin Blade
.
