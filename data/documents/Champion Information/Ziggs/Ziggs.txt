The mine cluster is built of 2 rings, with 3 mines in the inner ring (radius pending for test) and 8 mines on the other ring (200 radius), all equally spaced.

The angular offset is randomized on each cast.

Because of the 135 detonation radius of each mine, the total possible range of a mine from the minefield hitting an enemy from the cast location is 335 units. It will often be slightly less as the minefield is not guaranteed to be angled the right way for this.

Mines will not explode upon contact with player-generated terrain.

With a love of big bombs and short fuses, the yordle Ziggs is an explosive force of nature. As an inventor’s assistant in Piltover, he was bored by his predictable life and befriended a mad, blue-haired bomber named Jinx. After a wild night on the town, Ziggs took her advice and moved to Zaun, where he now explores his fascinations more freely, terrorizing the chem-barons and regular citizens alike in his never ending quest to blow stuff up.

Ziggs's full name is Zigmund, from Proto-Germanic *segiz ‘victory’ & *mundō ‘protection’; the latter element is shared with Dr. Mundo.

Ziggs and Nautilus were first conceived as 'Ivan the Mad Bomber'.

Hexplosive Minefield was conceived as Ziggs's ultimate (was later replaced by Mega Inferno Bomb).

Mega Inferno Bomb's icon references a nuclear weapon.

Ziggs seems to be the mascot for featured game modes.

This is evident from his likeness being used on numerous summoner icons that represent or commemorate them, as well as having his teaser picture be the base for the promotional art for a lot of these game modes.

There are also videos where the following are crafted:

Diana's Crescent Moonblade (functional)

Katarina's Daggers (functional)

Leona's Zenith Blade (functional)

Master Yi's 'Highlander' Ring Sword (functional)

Poppy's Hammer of Orlon (functional)

Yasuo's 'Last Breath' Sword (functional)

The icon for Satchel Charge is reused for the Teamfight Tactics item Demolitionist's Charge.
