**Abilities**

* Icathian Surprise
  + Effect radius: 400
  + Passive: Upon taking fatal damage, Kog'Maw enters a zombie state for 4 seconds, becoming ghosted and gaining 10% bonus movement speed that increases up to 50% over the duration. At the end of the duration, he explodes to deal 140 − 650 (based on level) true damage to nearby enemies.
    * While under this state, Kog'Maw is invulnerable, untargetable, and immune to crowd control, but is also rendered unable to declare basic attacks, cast abilities, use summoner spells, and activate items.
  + Details: Kog'Maw's usable summoner spells are placed on a 5-second cooldown upon becoming a zombie. During Icathian Surprise, Kog'Maw's attack range is reduced to 0 by 500, making him automatically path near enemies he is trying to target. Zombie states trigger upon taking lethal damage. Raw damage effects will not prevent zombie states from triggering. All resurrection effects take precedence over effects that reanimate as a zombie. A champion that enters a zombie state will start their death timer upon triggering the effect. Most buffs and debuffs will be lost upon transitioning into a zombie state. Undisplayed marker buffs, such as those imposed by Veigar's Event Horizon and Viktor's Gravity Field to prevent being affected multiple times by the same effect, are lost.

    * Minimum Magic Damage: 100 / 140 / 180 (+ 75 bonus AD) (+ 35% AP)
    * Maximum Magic Damage: 200 / 280 / 360 (+ 150 bonus AD) (+ 70% AP)
