              Deadly Venom
              Innate: Twitch's basic attacks on-hit apply a stack of Deadly Venom for 6 seconds, refreshing on subsequent applications and stacking up to 6 times.
              •
              Deadly Venom: For each stack, the target is dealt 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 (based on level) (+ 3% AP) true damage per second over the duration, 6 / 12 / 18 / 24 / 30 (based on level) (+ 18% AP) total true damage over the duration, and 36 / 72 / 108 / 144 / 180 (based on level) (+ 108% AP) total true damage with each tick.

              This effect is considered a poison.

                •
                Active: After a 1-second delay, Twitch becomes camouflaged for a duration. Attacking or casting Venom Cask or Contaminate ends Ambush immediately.
                •
                Stealth Duration: 10 / 11 / 12 / 13 / 14

                During this time, Twitch gains 10% bonus movement speed, increased to 30% while facing enemy champions within a 1000-unit radius who cannot see him.

                •
                Details:
                  * Entering stealth cancels Twitch's current basic attack.
                  * Ambush follows the same rules as stealth but he can still perform actions normally before entering camouflage.
                  * Activating Recall during the 1-second delay allows him to channel it while stealthed.
                  * If Twitch enters stasis during the delay, he will gain the camouflage after the stasis ends.

                Venom Cask's missile will fail to fire if Twitch is suppressed during the cast time.

                •
                Contaminate will deal the additional damage to targets based on the number of Deadly Venom stacks they had at the start of the cast time.
                Twitch is given a range indicator for Contaminate's radius upon infecting an enemy champion with Deadly Venom (actual range is slightly larger than shown by the indicator).
                Contaminate will not deal damage to enemies that are not within range of the ability before the cast time completes.
                If the target moves out of range after the cast time, they are still dealt the damage.

                  Active: Twitch gains bonus attack damage and 300 bonus attack range for 6 seconds, during which his basic attacks are replaced by bolts that travel slightly further than his attack range in a straight line, dealing damage to every enemy unit hit.
                  •

                  The bolts deal 100% − 60% (based on enemies hit) of the attack's damage, apply on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness, and can critically strike.

                  Tips & Tricks:
                    * Spray and Pray allows Twitch to outrange turrets by 50 units, allowing him to hit them without them returning fire.
                    * Twitch targets his line attack at his target's location at the start of his attack windup.
                    * The bolts reach targets at a delay, composed of Twitch's windup time and distance the bolt has to travel at finite speed. Even the primary target can dodge the attack if they are moving quickly enough.
                    * The bolt projectiles will naturally pass through terrain and enemy structures (the latter will be damaged by bolts even if they are not directly targeted).
                    * If Twitch is blinded before winding up the attack, the hits will miss against all targets.
                    * Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury interactions with Spray and Pray's bonus attack range but not with the modified missile effect (the secondary bolts will not have pass-through effects).
                    * Whenever the bolts penetrate a target, a small elongated cloud appears at the location, which's VFX and SFX can be seen and heard inside the Fog of War.
                    * The bolt missile has to only touch (pass within its half width of 60 units) the edge of the unit's radius to be able to hit them.
                  •
                  Tips & Tricks:
                    * Runaan's Hurricane's bolts can target the same units that are hit by Twitch's penetrated bolts, increasing the total damage dealt to them and applying on-hit effects twice.

                      Description: A Zaunite plague rat by birth, but a connoisseur of filth by passion, Twitch is not afraid to get his paws dirty. Aiming a chem-powered crossbow at the gilded heart of Piltover, he has vowed to show those in the city above just how filthy they really are. Always a sneaky sneak, when he’s not rooting around in the Sump, he’s digging deep into other people's garbage for discarded treasures… and perhaps a moldy sandwich.

While other crime bosses in the port city may loathe to get their hands dirty, Twitch revels in wading into the filth himself—crossbow in hand, and a finely aged egg in his pocket.

                      Description: Twitch is a bitter, hateful creature who has jealously watched the Winterlands from his frozen burrow since time immemorial. Finally driven to the surface by twisted delusions of grandeur, he now seeks to usurp the Poro King, corrupting his subjects with an ancient, icy curse.

                      Description: An extremely aggravating presence both in-game and at the table, Twitch Shadowfoot is the adorable Rift Quest counterpart to the actual Twitch, who is insane. Unsurprisingly, the cuddly rat-man rogue spends nearly every turn stealing his companions' equipment, mumbling of a vast conspiracy to overthrow him from his 'toilet kingdom'.

                              [
                              ]
                              Twitch was voiced by the late Doug Boyd.
                              Twitch is voiced by an unknown voice actor in the Wild Rift Chat shorts.
                              Deadly Venom displaying an X when fully stacked on a target might be referencing the Black Death (the doors of those afflicted were marked as such).
