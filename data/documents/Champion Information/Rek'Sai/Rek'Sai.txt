          Fury of the Xer'Sai
          ]
          Innate: Rek'Sai basic attacks and ability hits generate 25 Fury. After 8 seconds of being out of combat, she loses 20 Fury per second. Fury gain is reduced by 50% against minions, wards, and plants. Prey Seeker will not generate Fury against non-champions. When Rek'Sai becomes Burrowed, she consumes her current Fury over 3 seconds to heal for up to 12% − 20% of maximum health at 100 Fury, stopping once fully consumed or she reaches full health. If she starts generating Fury while Burrowed, the consumption occurs after 5 seconds.

          Passive
          Fury bar changes from Yellow to Red when full. When Rek'Sai automatically consumes Fury while Burrowed (no transformation), the healing buff will refresh every second while she has/maintains over 25 Fury.
          (bug)
          This causes the healing to last 6 seconds at 100 Fury.

            Only the damage to the primary target is affected by critical strike modifiers. Damage to the primary target applies proc damage and damage to secondary targets applies default damage. Queen's Wrath's bonus damage applies against structures. When dodged or blocked, or if Rek'Sai is blinded, the damage dealt to the primary target is nullified, but the damage around her still occurs.

                Active: Rek'Sai becomes Un-Burrowed, gaining access to her Un-Burrowed abilities. Additionally, she deals magic damage to nearby enemies and knocks them up for 1 second. Targets hit cannot be knocked up by Unburrow again for some time.

                Rek'Sai can also trigger Unburrow by issuing an attack command, applying the knock up against the target once she is in attack range.

                Rek'Sai's attack range is reduced by 50 while Burrowed, which makes an automatic cast of Unburrow always put Rek'Sai at least 50 units within her attack range against the target to follow up with. Note that the Unborrow effect radius is usually greater than 75, meaning Rek'Sai can knock up a single target from slightly further away when she casts Unburrow the standard way, but may have to walk slightly closer to attack that target afterwards. Unburrow does not count as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. Unburrow is still considered an ability and is thus stopped by silence. She can basic attack normally during this time, without leaving unburrow. For a brief moment during the beginning animation of Tunnel, Rek'Sai can trigger Unburrow by issuing an attack command.

                  Active: Rek'Sai dashes in the target direction, leaving behind a Tunnel with two interconnected entrances that lasts up to 10 minutes. The Tunnel can be traversed again when Rek'Sai targets either entrance, shutting down the Tunnel for a few seconds. Rek'Sai can have up to 8 Tunnels active on the map at once, but deploying beyond the maximum destroys the oldest one. Enemy champions can destroy a Tunnel by standing on either entrance for 1.5 seconds, granting them 5 upon successfully destroying the Tunnel. An Un-Burrowed Rek'Sai will automatically Burrow before entering the Tunnel and automatically Unburrow after exiting it. This does not put Burrow on cooldown nor trigger Fury of the Xer'Sai, but does trigger other Burrow and Unburrow effects. Rek'Sai cannot enter a tunnel while immobilized, grounded, or silenced.

                  Creating a Tunnel grants sight of the area at the other end for 2 seconds. Tunnel entrances can be targeted by allied movement abilities (ex: Leap Strike, Shunpo, Safeguard, Teleport). Tunnel entrances are visible on allied champions' minimaps, while enemies must first gain sight of one before it becomes visible on theirs (the opposite entrance is not revealed). Destroying a Tunnel while Rek'Sai is traversing it will not prevent her from reaching the opposite entrance. Rek'Sai can Tunnel through terrain if she dashes close to them and the wall is thin enough to allow the opposite entrance to spawn on the other side. If Rek'Sai issues an attack command while the dash passes by an enemy, the target will be knocked up but Rek'Sai will still complete the movement. Enemies can block Rek'Sai from using a tunnel entrance if a ward is placed directly over it, because the cursor's target selection prioritizes wards over tunnel entrances. Rek'Sai will take longer to enter a Tunnel from Un-Burrowed state because she needs to become Burrowed first.

After 1.5 seconds, she becomes targetable again and emerges from the ground Un-Burrowed near the target and pounces at them, dealing physical damage and dashing 125 units through them.

                  If the target dies or is too far away before Rek'Sai vanishes, Void Rush is canceled with a 10-second cooldown.

                  An apex predator, Rek’Sai is a merciless Void-spawn that tunnels beneath the ground to ambush and devour unsuspecting prey. Her insatiable hunger has laid waste to entire regions of the once-great empire of Shurima—merchants, traders, even armed caravans, will go hundreds of miles out of their way to avoid her and her offspring’s hunting grounds. All know that once Rek'Sai is seen on the horizon, death from below is all but guaranteed.

                  When the Ice Witch looked to the great glaciers of True Ice towering over the far north, she saw an army in the making. Among the first to be sculpted was Rek'Sai, a vessel of chilling savagery befitting a queen's power. Now, granted sentience by the will of the Watchers, she terrorizes domains with the brutal instincts of an apex predator.

                                                                      Rek'Sai had her game assets reused for several featured game modes.

                                                                      Her animations were reused for the Anchortail, Brightcore, and Rhinodon monsters in Odyssey: Extraction.
