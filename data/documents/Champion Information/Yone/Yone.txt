**Way of the Hunter**

- **Innate - Intent:** Yone's total critical strike chance is multiplied by 2.

- **Additionally, every 1% critical strike chance in excess of 100% is converted into 0.4 bonus AD.**
- **Every 50% critical strike chance in excess of 100% is converted into 20 bonus AD.**
- **Innate - Steel and Spirit:** Yone's basic attacks alternate between his Steel Sword and Azakana Sword on-attack.**
- **Yone begins attacking with Steel Sword, and basic attacks with Azakana Sword deal 50% AD physical damage and 50% AD magic damage.**
- **There is no attack time-out between alternating swords. It will persist through death.**
- **50% of Spellblade and Demolish damage will be converted to magic damage if applied by the Azakana Sword.**
- **This will also occur if applied by Guinsoo's Rageblade's Phantom Hit after having last attacked with the Azakana Sword.**
- **This will also occur if applied by Mortal Steel after having last attacked with the Azakana Sword.**
