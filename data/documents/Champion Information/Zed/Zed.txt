The buff is granted briefly after

If cast at minimum distance, the buff and the

If cast at greater than the minimum distance, then the buff's duration will start before the

Zed

gains a buff for 7.
5
seconds that indicates and determines the duration in which he may recast
Death Mark
.

The buff is granted on-cast and lingers for 0.
25
seconds after it expires.

The
Shadow
is spawned the moment
Death Mark
is cast.

Zed

will track the target if they change locations.

He will dash through the target's previous location while still applying the
mark
if they are 2200 or more units away.

Zed

will be ordered to basic attack his target after reappearing.

Death Mark's
stored damage derives from all
basic attacks
,
abilities
,
items
,
runes
and
buffs
.

Death Mark's
Shadow
is functionally the same as a regular one, but it lasts longer and can be swapped to regardless of range.

The range at which it mimics
Zed's
abilities does not change.

The
mark
can be prevented by becoming
untargetable
before it is applied (untargetability after application will not prevent the mark's detonation).

Spell shields

will only block the
mark's
application. They will not prevent
Zed
from initiating the cast nor block the detonation from a
mark
that is already applied.

If
Zed
dies during
Death Mark
, the ability will cancel instantly and he will reappear at his current location. The cooldown is not compensated.

If he enters
resurrection
before the dash,
Death Mark
does not cancel. If he enters it while dashing, the dash is interrupted.

If the
dash
is interrupted,
Zed
stops, places himself to the ground (ends all displacements affecting him, but does not remove
airborne
effects), and reappears prematurely at his current location. The
mark
will still be applied regardless.

Zed

will remove
airborne
effects from himself immediately upon starting the dash.

Once
Zed
begins the
dash
, two
Shadows
will also appear to be dashing through his target, each one spawning a certain distance behind the target (from the right and left). These
shadows
do
not
mimic abilities and disappear immediately after they stop dashing but they grant
sight
of their surroundings.

These
shadows
have a tracking distance of 2200 and a dash speed of 1750.

Death Mark
does not cancel if the target enters a
zombie state
before the dash begins.

If the
mark's
post-mitigation damage
is higher than the target's
current
health, a
spinning shuriken
will appear above the victim. This does not necessarily mean the target will die, as it does not consider
shields
or forms of
damage modifiers
that are not respected by this predictive calculation.

A green arrow (blue in colorblind mode) indicates the

A yellow arrow indicates the

A red arrow (orange in colorblind mode) indicates the

Utterly ruthless and without mercy, Zed is the leader of the Order of Shadow, an organization he created with the intent of militarizing Ionia’s magical and martial traditions to drive out Noxian invaders. During the war, desperation led him to unlock the secret shadow form—a malevolent spirit magic as dangerous and corrupting as it is powerful. Zed has mastered all of these forbidden techniques to destroy anything he sees as a threat to his nation, or his new order.

An elite operative of the Shockblade order, Zed dives into battle with lightning-fast lethality. Though his former partner Shen hasn't forgiven himself for nearly getting Zed killed, Zed still urges him to return to the front lines; and yet the Storm rages on, whether or not the duo are reunited. Zed will bring its fury to bear alone if he must.

Trivia

Zed

is one of 20 champions without a single
ability power
ratio on any ability:
Aatrox
,
Camille
,
Darius
,
Dr. Mundo
,
Draven
,
Garen
,
Kayn
,
Kled
,
Naafiri
,
Nilah
,
Olaf
,
Pyke
,
Riven
,
Samira
,
Sett
,
Talon
,
Urgot
,
Xayah
, and
Yone
.

Zed's dance was inspired
[2]
by various martial arts (the animator is a
black belt
).

Zed is the first champion to not actually 'die', instead he drops into a
shadow portal
(Shockblade Zed disappears after struck by a
lightning bolt)
. The second is
Ekko
, who rewinds time.
Willump
does die, but
Nunu
does not.
Zed,
Sona
,
Garen
and
Vi
were targeted by
Jhin
in his teaser.
After Zed was
shot
, his champion icon on his
League of Legends
page
and the
champion list
was updated to a
gif
with petals blowing past him.
Zed is the fifth champion to use energy as a resource for abilities (the others being
Akali
,
Kennen
and
Shen
).
Before the release of
Galaxy Slayer Zed
and
Pulsefire Shen
, neither him nor
Shen
reveal their faces in any of their skins, unlike
Akali
(
All-star
,
Nurse
,
Blood Moon
) and
Kennen
(
Karate
,
M.D.
).
Zed and
Lucian
perform the
'airplane arms'
run when having very high movement speed.
Razor Shuriken
,
Living Shadow
, and
Shadow Slash
respectively mirroring
Thundering Shuriken
,
Shadow Dash
, and
Crescent Slash
, as well as
Death Mark
,
Assassin's Mark
, and
Mark of the Storm
marking their targets reference Zed having been a Kinkou Order member.
Death Mark
was
conceived
with spawning two
Living Shadows
and was animated accordingly on release.
Clicking one of the
Living Shadows
during
Death Marks
animation used to display
Akali's
portrait. This could only be done while spectating in slow motion as his shadows in an actual game were just simply too fast to be clicked on. It was removed after the new HUD came in 2015 and replaced the old one.
Zed and his enemy counterpart could theoretically increase their AD infinitely with
Reaper of Shadows
by alternating killing each other, before it was removed from the game in
V9.4
.
Zed used to gain the
'Law of Inverse Ninja Strength'
cosmetic
Easter egg
debuff (
"This unit is a flippin' ninja!"
-
"Ninjas are more effective when they work alone. For every Ninja on your team beyond yourself, you lose 1 health."
) when he,
Akali
,
Kennen
and/or
Shen
found themselves on the same team. It was removed in
V3.14
for unknown reasons.
At 23 August 2018 players who selected "Assassin" as their favorite class rated Zed 27% higher than the other assassins as "One of my favorite champions". This difference is the largest for a champion by class.
