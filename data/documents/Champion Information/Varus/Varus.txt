**Living Vengeance (Passive)**

* **Type:** Passive
* **Details:** Whenever Varus kills an enemy, he gains bonus attack speed for a short duration. This bonus is larger if the enemy is a champion.

**Piercing Arrow (Q)**

* **Cost:** 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 / 85 mana
* **Cooldown:** 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 seconds
* **Cast time:** None
* **Range:** 895 - 1595 (based on channel time)
* **Width:** 140
* **Speed:** 1900
* **Description:** Varus charges while being slowed by 20% for up to 4 seconds to increase Piercing Arrow's range and damage over the first 1.25 seconds of the channel. Piercing Arrow can be recast within the duration. If the charge completes without reactivation, Piercing Arrow is cancelled and refunds 50% of the mana cost.
* **Recast:** Varus fires a piercing arrow in the target direction that deals physical damage to enemies hit. The damage of the arrow as well as any detonated Blight stacks are increased, and the arrow's damage is reduced by enemies hit.

**Blighted Quiver (W)**

* **Cost:** 40 mana
* **Cooldown:** None
* **Passive:** Varus' basic attacks are empowered to deal bonus magic damage and apply a stack of Blight on-hit for 6 seconds, refreshing on subsequent applications and stacking up to 3 times. Varus' abilities consume all Blight stacks on enemies hit to apply the effect.
* **Bonus Magic Damage:** 7 / 13 / 19 / 25 / 31 (+35% AP)
* **Blight:** For each stack consumed, the target is dealt bonus magic damage. Against a champion or epic monster, this also reduces their basic abilities' current cooldowns by 12% of the total cooldown for each stack, up to 36% per target. This damage is capped at 360 against monsters.
* **Bonus Magic Damage per Stack:** 3 / 3.5 / 4 / 4.5 / 5% (+1.5% per 100 AP)
* **Maximum Bonus Magic Damage:** 13.5 / 15.5 / 17.5 / 19.5 / 21.5% (+6.75% per 100 AP)
* **of the target's maximum health**
* **Active:** Varus' next Piercing Arrow within 5.5 seconds is empowered to deal bonus magic damage, increased by 0% - 50% (based on Piercing Arrow's channel time), for a maximum of 9.5% - 21.5% (+6.75% per 100 AP) of the target's missing health. This damage is capped at 360 against monsters.
* **If Varus does not cast Piercing Arrow, Blighted Quiver can be recast after 1 second within the duration, and will be placed on full cooldown even if Piercing Arrow is not recast.**

**Hail of Arrows (E)**

* **Cost:** 80 mana
* **Cooldown:** 18 / 16 / 14 / 12 / 10 seconds
* **Cast time:** 0.2419 seconds
* **Target range:** 925
* **Effect radius:** 300
* **Description:** Varus fires a hail of arrows at the target location that land after 0.5 seconds, dealing physical damage to enemies hit. The area then becomes desecrated for 4 seconds, slowing enemies within and inflicting them with Grievous Wounds.
* **Physical Damage:** 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 (+90% bonus AD)
* **Slow:** 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50%
* **Hail of Arrows will cast at max range if cast beyond that.**
* **Slow lingers for 0.25 seconds after leaving the marked area.**
* **Hail of Arrows consumes Blighted Quiver stacks for bonus damage a second time after ~0.3 seconds of hitting, allowing stacks applied during this time to be triggered.**

**Map-Specific Differences**

* **Arena:** Cooldown changed to 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 seconds.

**Chain of Corruption (R)**

* **Cost:** 100 mana
* **Cooldown:** 100 / 80 / 60 seconds
* **Cast time:** 0.2419 seconds
* **Range:** 1370
* **Effect radius:** 650
* **Width:** 240
* **Tether radius:** 650
* **Speed:** 1500
* **Description:** Varus unleashes a tendril of corruption in the target direction that infects the first enemy champion hit, dealing magic damage and rooting them for 2 seconds, during which they are revealed. Over the first 1.5 seconds, they are also inflicted with maximum stacks of Blight.
* **Magic Damage:** 150 / 250 / 350 (+100% AP)
* **Upon impact, the tendril roots into the ground from which it seeks out nearby enemy champions.**
* **If a target does not leave the area within 2 seconds, they subsequently become infected as well, taking the same damage and effects.**
* **A new tendril is then spread out from the infected target that is closest to a nearby uninfected enemy champion.**
* **The target does not have to be visible to be caught by the tendril.**
* **Enemy champions can be targeted again by the corruption's tether if they were not infected the previous time, even if they were targeted and got out of range.**
* **A tendril that roots into the ground will only seek nearby enemy champions that were already in the area.**
* **Chain of Corruption will not infect crowd control immune targets or those protected by spell shields (but will still seek them).**
* **Varus will turn to face the target direction at the start of the cast.**
* **The tendril cannot seek enemy champions that are untargetable.**
* **This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.**
* **Consuming the Blight's stacks applied by Chain of Corruption will deal bonus magic damage based on Blighted Quiver's rank. If the ability hasn't been ranked yet, the three Blight stacks will still be applied but they will be considered to be at rank 0, dealing 1.25% (+2% per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health per stack.**

* 08.05.2012
* One of the ancient darkin, Varus was a deadly killer who loved to torment his foes, driving them almost to insanity before delivering the killing arrow. He was imprisoned at the end of the Great Darkin War, but escaped centuries later in the remade flesh of two Ionian hunters—they had unwittingly released him, cursed to bear the bow containing his bound essence. Varus now seeks out those who trapped him, in order to enact his brutal vengeance, but the mortal souls within still resist him every step of the way.

* Wielding radiant mineral bows, three excavators dove into a cave of crystalline monsters. But only the grimly determined Varus emerged. While shattering the horrors that lurked in dark depths, they lost all grasp of time, sense, and self. Varus became an amalgam of crystal, monster, and man—now fracturing the world he once sought to make safe.
