**Trivia**

- Swain is named after the Old Norse word for 'boy'.
- Swain's raven is named Beatrice.
- Swain's Ravenous Flock transformation has a similar appearance to Tzeentch's daemon servants, the Lords of Change, from the Warhammer franchise.
- Swain's first splash art was the first one ever released for League of Legends.
- If Swain dies while casting Decrepify, there will be two Beatrices on the battlefield, one attached to the laser and one on his back when he falls to the ground.
- The ending quote to Swain's background is based on Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22.
- In League of Legends, Swain was unable to compete in the Ionia Versus Noxus Grudge Match due to his recent induction into Noxian High Command, thus needing to take time away from the League to put all his affairs in order.
- In the 2014 version of the Ultra Rapid Fire featured game mode, Ravenous Flock would toggle-off once its mana cost scaled beyond Swain's maximum mana. This was the only ability affected by the restriction of a champion requiring sufficient maximum mana in order to activate an ability within the game mode.
- Swain is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect: Aurelion Sol, Bard, Bel'Veth, Cho'Gath, Draven, Kindred, Nasus, Senna, Shyvana, Sion, Smolder, Sylas, Thresh, and Veigar.
- Swain's Vision of Empire is the longest ranged basic ability in League of Legends, at 7500 units.
- Swain's dance references Fred Astaire's Top Hat, White Tie & Tails dance.
- At the start of the game, there is a chance of thematic music with ravens in the background.
- Swain's demonic left arm could be a reference to Murtaugh in the Submachine series. After losing his left arm, Murtaugh discovered he had a third 'karma' arm, which was extremely powerful and capable of causing mass destruction. Murtaugh pursues his goals with similar ruthlessness as Swain.
- The sigil that appears beneath Swain when his ultimate ability is cast has three runes and three eyes inscribed into it. This is possibly a reference to the Three-eyed Raven from the book series A Song of Ice and Fire, considering both characters possess the ability to see events occurring around the world through magical means.
- The sigil used in Original Swain, Northern Front Swain, Bilgewater Swain, and Tyrant Swain is an edited version of the sigil that appears when Gatekeeper Galio uses his ultimate ability.
- Demon Master Swain uses the unedited of the sigil.
- The head of Raum, Swain's demon, shortly appears above Swain when he uses his ultimate ability.
