**Break the Mold**

**Break the Mold**

**Innate:**

Rell's basic attacks and abilities against non-minions reduce the target's armor and magic resistance by 2% for 5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent hits and stacking up to 5 times for a maximum of 10% reduction. Rell gains bonus armor and bonus magic resistance equal to the sum resistances reduced from all afflicted enemies.

**Break the Mold**

will reduce the target's armor and magic resistance by a minimum of 0.8−2 (based on level). Rell's attack windup is reduced by 0%−7.14% (based on level).

**Active:**

Rell becomes Dismounted and leaps to the target location over the cast time, granting herself a shield that lasts until destroyed or casting Ferromancy: Mount Up. Upon arrival, she deals magic damage to nearby enemies and knocks them up for 1 second. She will continue sliding forward another 320 units over 0.5 seconds, though not through terrain, affecting further enemies along her path.

While Rell is Dismounted, she can cast Ferromancy: Mount Up. Upon completing a Recall channel or respawning, Rell will automatically revert to Mounted form without casting the ability and reset Ferromancy: Mount Up's cooldown.

This ability can be cast only while Rell is Mounted. Rell can cast Magnet Storm during the dash, and is not considered to be dismounted until after the leap ends. Ferromancy: Crash Down will cast at max range if cast beyond that.

**Notes**
Rell slides between 250 and 350 units in testing, depending on how far the spell was targeted. It is not known where this is intended.

If Rell dashes before a wall on the map, the slide will cover a shorter distance to the terrain over the same time, moving slower.

PENDING FOR TEST: Interaction with player-made walls.

The following table refers for interactions while Rell is dashing/in cast time:

The basic attack reset is not considered one for Hail of Blades.

Rell can use the empowered attack even while grounded or rooted.

The dash can be knocked down but the attack's effects will still be applied.

The movement speed reduction is a negative bonus, not a slow, and is thus not reduced by slow resist.

Displacement immunity will not resist the application of the stun.

If the target becomes untargetable, dies, or is too far away or no longer in sight during the empowered attack's cast time, it is cancelled but not consumed.

The product of brutal experimentation at the hands of the Black Rose, Rell is a defiant, living weapon determined to topple Noxus. Her childhood was one of misery and horror, enduring unspeakable procedures to perfect and weaponize her magical control over metal... until she staged a violent escape, killing many of her captors in the process. Now branded as a criminal, Rell attacks Noxian soldiers on sight as she searches for survivors of her old 'academy,' defending the meek while delivering violent death to her former overseers.

A young woman from the magic-starved Queendom of Calamity, volunteered for the coronation by a shadowy cabal of aristocrats after a series of magical experiments. Having now won the crown and the power of her crest, Rell has discovered her powers were stolen from the people of her country, and she has vowed revenge on her puppeteers.

Rell ran as her home rotted away at the Fifth Harbinger's hands, but the young Powder Witch ain't running now. She squares her shoulders and swings into the saddle of a horse made of magic, steam, and fire. From its back, she looks down at the haunted gunslinger. “Come on, old man. We got a second chance, I ain't gonna waste it.”
