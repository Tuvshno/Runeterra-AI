**Trivia**

* Sejuani's name resembles that of Roman equestrian Sejanus.
* Sejuani's direct ancestor Serylda's name comes from two Germanic roots: *sarwo* 'armor, equipment' and *hildiz* 'fight, battle'.
* Sejuani's name might be inspired by the boar Gullinbursti from Norse mythology.
* Sejuani is referenced in Assassin's Creed Valhalla.
* Sejuani is currently the champion with the shortest time between their initial release and a full visual gameplay update, at 1 year and 3 months.
* Sejuani was the first champion released in 2012.
* In Sejuani's Art Spotlight, the artist names the layer that has the boar on it 'Piggles'.
* If Ashe, Lissandra, and/or Sejuani are played on opposing teams, Battle for Freljord will trigger. This in-game quest consists in one killing the other to earn the title of 'Queen of Freljord' (complete with a floating ice crown floating above their heads) referencing the civil war taking place there, between the three tribes each lead.
* Sejuani, Fury of the North is the only champion in the game that does not have a standard magic resistance scaling (30-38.5 or 32.1-53.35), though she does share this trait with Mega Gnar as he has different base stats to Gnar.
* Sejuani, Karma, Lee Sin, and Trundle are the only champions to feature a 'traditional' skin representing them before their visual updates (hers was conceived after an unreleased 'Queen' skin).
* Sejuani's animations were recycled for the Tuskbeard monster from Odyssey: Extraction, a rotating game mode.
