* Other MOBA's than League of Legends (such as Heroes of Newerth, Smite, and Dota 2) also feature a character based on Sun Wukong. These expies of the Monkey King (including Smite's pre-worked Sun Wukong) have similar abilities and playstyles (mainly being damaging tanks with assassin potential, and having very unique tricks with their abilities).
* Wukong is one of a few champions to have multiple textures in one skin. When he uses Warrior Trickster, his clone will be of a different colour palette which can only be seen by Wukong and his allies. To the opposing team, the two Wukongs look exactly the same, including copies of any external buffs and item effect active at the moment the clone is spawned (Prior to patch V5.22, clones did not duplicate external buff/active item effect particles).
* Four other champions with this feature are LeBlanc (via Mirror Image), Shaco's (via Hallucinate), Nasus (via Fury of the Sands), and Malphite (via Granite Shield and Thunderclap).
* Wukong's critical strike animation is a possible nod to a famous pole-vaulting kick used by many incarnations of the original Sun Wukong, especially in the TV drama adaptations of Journey to the West, and his Warriors Orochi / Musou Orochi incarnation as well.
* When a Wukong Bot uses Warrior Trickster, the decoy is named "MonkeyKing Bot".
* Wukong is the only champion with two Lunar Revel skins.

Before his gameplay update, Cyclone was originally tied as one of the highest AD ratio abilities in the game.
