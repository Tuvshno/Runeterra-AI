      - Isolation references Alien (Kha'Zix's main inspiration).
      - Being an arthropodic invader from another world with scythes as his primary weapon, he also bears a striking resemblance to the real-life mantis & Metroid's Space Pirates, though he also possesses beetles' hardened outer wings.

      - Kha'Zix can spend evolution points on abilities he has not learned yet (doing this only benefits Taste Their Fear for the bonus range on basic attacks).
