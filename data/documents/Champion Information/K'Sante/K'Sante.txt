**Abilities**

[ ] **Edit**

**Dauntless Instinct**

- **Innate:** K'Sante's abilities mark enemies hit for 4 seconds. His basic attacks against marked enemies are empowered to gain 25 bonus range and consume the mark on-hit, dealing 5 - 20 (based on level) (1 / 1.33 / 1.66 / 1.99 / 2.32% of target's maximum health) bonus physical damage. The health-based portion deals a minimum of 15 - 100 (based on level) damage against minions and 20 - 105 (based on level) against monsters.
- **All Out:** Both the attack's damage and the mark damage are increased by 30% - 78% (based on level). The bonus damage dealt by consuming a mark is converted to true damage.

**Hide**

**Details**

**Map-Specific Differences**

**Info**

**Targeting input:** Passive, Damage type: Type: Sub-type: Proc damage: Physical / True

**Counters:** Spell shield, Parries, See Notes

**Spell shield** will block the mark's application, but not the mark's consumption from an attack. The empowered attack can be dodged, blocked, and missed while blinded but the mark will not be consumed. Starting the empowered attack while the mark is about to time out will not extend the mark duration, but still complete the attack and apply the bonus damage.

**Map-Specific Differences**

**Ultra Rapid Fire differences:** Health ratio changed to 1% - 2.66% (based on level) maximum health. All Out health ratio changed to 1.8 / 2.4 / 2.9 / 3.5 / 4.1% (based on level) maximum health.

**Ntofo Strikes**

- **Cost:** 28 / 26 / 24 / 22 / 20 mana
- **Cast time:** 0.45 - 0.25 (based on bonus health) seconds
- **Static cooldown:** 3.5 - 1.75 (based on bonus resistances) seconds
- **Range:** 465 / 930
- **Width:** 150 / 140
- **Active:** K'Sante slams his ntofo down in the target direction that deals physical damage to enemies hit and slows them by 80% for 0.5 seconds. If this hits at least one enemy, K'Sante generates a stack for 6 seconds, stacking up to 2 times and refreshing on subsequent hits. At 2 stacks, the next Ntofo Strikes consumes them all to become empowered with a new effect.
- **Empowered Active:** K'Sante fires a shockwave in the target direction that applies the same effects to enemies hit, but also pulls them towards him over 0.65 seconds and then stuns them for 0.25 seconds.
- **All Out Bonus:** Ntofo Strikes no longer applies its slow, but its cooldown is reduced by 25%, with a minimum total cooldown of 1.33 seconds, and its cast time is reduced by 0.08 seconds. Upon entering All Out, Ntofo Strikes' stacks are reset and its cooldown is refreshed. Ntofo Strikes resets K'Sante's basic attack timer.

**This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. If Ntofo Strikes hits no more than one enemy champion, K'Sante will be ordered an attack command against them. The basic attack reset is not considered one for Hail of Blades. Temporary increases/decreases in bonus resistances will count for reducing/increasing Ntofo Strikes' cooldown. Only the empowered active is a projectile. The following table refers for interactions while K'Sante is in the cast time of the third cast: Type: Cast time: Attacking: Disabled: Abilities: Disabled: Movement: Disabled: Items: Usable: Shurelya's Battlesong, Youmuu's Ghostblade, Randuin's Omen: Disabled: All the other item-actives are disabled: Interrupted by: N/A: Consumables: Usable: Spells: Usable: Barrier, Clarity, Cleanse, Exhaust, Ghost, Heal, Ignite, Smite: Disabled: Flash, Teleport, Recall, Hexflash: Interrupted by: N/A: Interrupted by: Death, unless protected by Resurrection: Tips & Tricks: Using Footwork on top of an enemy immediately followed by an empowered Ntofo Strikes allows K'Sante to fling enemies behind him, including through walls.**

**Map-Specific Differences**

**Arena differences:** Base damage changed to 40 / 80 / 120 / 160 / 200. Base cooldown changed to 2.75 / 2.4 / 2.05 / 1.7 / 1.35 seconds.

**Path Maker**

- **Cost:** 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 mana

- **Cast time:** None
- **Range:** 450 / 1300 / 1800
- **Speed:** 1300 / 1500 / 1800
- **Active:** K'Sante charges for a minimum of 0.66 seconds and up to 1.5 seconds, during which he increases Path Maker's range, damage, and stun duration over the first 0.75 seconds of the channel and gains displacement immunity and 40% - 65% (based on level) damage reduction. Path Maker can be recast within the duration and does so automatically afterwards. Path Maker's charge cannot be interrupted by crowd control.
- **Recast:** K'Sante dashes in the target direction, though not through terrain, dealing physical damage to enemies he passes through, carrying them alongside him, and stunning them for 0.35 / 0.45 / 0.55 / 0.65 / 0.75 seconds. When charged, the damage goes up to 8.25 / 8.5 / 8.75 / 9 / 9.25% of target's maximum health and the stun goes up to 0.85 / 0.95 / 1.05 / 1.15 / 1.25 seconds. This damage is capped at 50 - 475 (based on level) against monsters.
- **All Out Bonus:** Path Maker no longer applies its knock back and stun, but its damage reduction is increased to 57.35% - 75% (based on level), and the dash speed is increased by 20%. Upon entering All Out, Path Maker's cooldown is refreshed. When charged, this bonus damage goes up to 110 / 170 / 230 / 290 / 350% of target's maximum health. Ntofo Strikes and All Out can be cast during the dash. Path Maker's recast can be used while affected by cast-inhibiting crowd control.

**Interrupted:** Disruption

**Path Maker cancels any existing movement or attack commands. However, new inputs given during the charge will be retained once the dash ends, except when the dash hits only one enemy champion. If Path Maker hits only one enemy champion, K'Sante will be ordered to basic attack them afterwards. K'Sante cannot use Flash during Path Maker's dash. Path Maker's dam age is not capped against monsters while empowered by All Out. (bug) Path Maker's recast can be used even while grounded or rooted, but the initial cast cannot. Path Maker can be recast by issuing an attack move command (or LMB) but not a targeted attack command. The following table refers for interactions while K'Sante is channeling: If the charge is cancelled, he will not automatically use the recast.

- **Cast time:** None
- **Range:** 250 / 400 / 550
- **Speed:** 900 / 1100 / 1450
- **Active:** K'Sante dashes to the target location, though not through terrain, and grants himself a shield for 50 / 90 / 130 / 170 / 210 ( + 10% bonus health) for 2 seconds. Footwork can be cast on allies to dash to them at an increased range. If the ally is a champion upon arrival, they receive the shield as well.

**Original**

View in 3D, 975 RP, 03.11.2022

Defiant and courageous, K'Sante battles colossal beasts and ruthless Ascended to protect his home of Nazumah, a coveted oasis amid the sands of Shurima. But after a falling-out with his former partner, K'Sante realizes that in order to become a warrior worthy of leading his city, he must temper his single-minded drive for success. Only then can he avoid falling prey to his own pride and find the wisdom he needs to defeat the vicious monsters threatening his people.

K'Sante prides himself on leading under adversity, but this is a challenge unlike any other. His realm is gone, he's living on borrowed time, and the other Empyreans don't realize that something released the Foreglow. Something bad. He knows only they can fix it, but they need their eyes opened. They need a leader.

An awe-inspiring presence—physically, emotionally, vocally—K'Sante is always focused on the bigger picture, determined for HEARTSTEEL to make its mark on the music industry. Though in his solo career his ambition often outpaced what one man can do alone, now that he's found friends and collaborators he believes in, K'Sante knows nothing can stop them.
