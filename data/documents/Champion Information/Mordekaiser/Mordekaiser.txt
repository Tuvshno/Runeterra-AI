**Mordekaiser**

* **Gameplay**
  * **Darkness Rise**
    * EFFECT RADIUS: 375
    * Innate: Mordekaiser's basic attacks are empowered to deal 40% AP bonus magic damage on-hit.
    * Mordekaiser generates a stack for each enemy champion or large monster hit by his damaging basic attacks or basic abilities, lasting for 4 seconds and refreshing on subsequent hits, stacking up to 3 times. At 3 stacks, he gains Darkness Rise.
    * Darkness Rise: Mordekaiser gains 3/6/9% (based on level) bonus movement speed and deals 5% − 15.2 (based on level) (+ 30% AP) (+ 1% − 5% (based on level) of target's maximum health) magic damage every second to nearby enemies. Against monsters, the damage is capped at 28 − 164 (based on level) per second. Against champions, the damage is 0.63 − 1.9 (based on level) (+ 3.75% AP) (+ 0.13 − 0.63% (based on level) of target's maximum health) magic damage every 0.125 seconds.
  * **Obliterate**
    * COOLDOWN: 9/7.75/6.5/5.25/4 seconds
    * CAST TIME: 0.5 seconds
    * RANGE: 625
    * WIDTH: 160
    * Active: Mordekaiser strikes his mace down in a line in the target direction, dealing magic damage to enemies within, increased if only one enemy is hit.
    * Magic Damage: 5 − 139 (based on level) (+ 75 / 95 / 115 / 135 / 155) (+ 70% AP)
    * Damage Increase: 40/45/50/55/60%
  * **Indestructible**
    * PASSIVE: Mordekaiser stores 45% of the post-mitigation damage he deals and 7.5% of the pre-mitigation damage he takes as Potential Shield on his secondary resource bar, up to 30% of his maximum health.
    * COOLDOWN: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds
    * CAST TIME: none
    * Active: Mordekaiser consumes his Potential Shield to grant himself a shield for the same amount for 4 seconds. The shield decays exponentially over the duration.
    * Active: Mordekaiser consumes the remaining shield, healing for 35/37.5/40/42.5/45% of the shield.
  * **Death's Grasp**
    * COOLDOWN: 18/16/14/12/10 seconds
    * CAST TIME: 0.25 seconds
    * TARGET RANGE: 700/900
    * WIDTH: 200
    * SPEED: 3000
    * Passive: Mordekaiser gains magic penetration.
    * Magic Penetration: 5/7.5/10/12.5/15%
    * Active: Mordekaiser summons a claw in the target direction that grants sight of the area. After 0.5 seconds, it deals magic damage to enemies within and pulls them 250 units.
    * Magic Damage: 80/95/110/125/140 (+ 60% AP)
  * **Realm of Death**
    * COOLDOWN: 140/120/100 seconds
    * CAST TIME: 0.5 seconds
    * TARGET RANGE: 650
    * EFFECT RADIUS: 1200
    * Active: Mordekaiser aims his mace towards the target enemy champion, slowing them by 75% and revealing them over the cast time, and then banishing them with him to the Death Realm for 7 seconds.
    * Mordekaiser also consumes the target's soul for 7 seconds, healing himself for 10% of their maximum health and reducing their current attack damage, ability power, total attack speed, maximum health, armor, magic resist, and size by 10%. If the target dies while inside the Death Realm, Mordekaiser keeps their partial stats until they respawn.
    * Units between realms see each other as spirits, considering each other dead and negating any interactions between the two. Only the target and Mordekaiser will enter the realm, other champions cannot follow them. Everything that occurs inside the Death Realm is hidden, and all non-champion pets still inside are destroyed at the end.
    * If one of the two affected champions leaves the Death Realm, because of having died or having it dispelled, the other will do so as well.
* **Mordekaiser's Realm of Death**
  * The Realm of Death is a battlefield that exists outside of the normal realm in an alternate "dimension." It exists only for Mordekaiser and his target. It consists of an arena that has a radius of 1200 units and includes any terrain features that would exist in the map of the normal realm, including walls and brushes.
  * The boundaries of the arena are impassable but not considered terrain themselves, and enemies that try to move out of the area will be displaced back inside. Dashes, blinks, displacements, and other forms of movement will cap their effect range to the boundary. Targets will stop at the boundary even after it expires.
  * Realm of Death retains Mordekaiser's previous current health percentage when granting him a portion of the target's maximum health.
  * Realm of Death can be dispelled if the target uses a cleansing effect, with the exceptions of Cleanse, Mikael's Blessing, and Kled's Dismount.
  * Mordekaiser or the target casting another Realm of Death will cause both champions to remain stuck for the duration of the new circle.
  * Spell shield will not block the initial slow.
  * The reveal effect lasts for 1.25 seconds from the start of the cast time if the cast does not complete. Otherwise, the reveal ends as soon as the cast time completes.
  * If the target's health is lower than the amount that should be stolen, they will be brought down to 1 health. Mordekaiser will still get the usual amount of maximum health.
  * Entering or leaving the Death Realm will cause all targeted projectiles to be destroyed. The transition in and out of the Death Realm does not interrupt channels.
  * Grand Starfall will always be interrupted from the transition into the realm.
  * Realm of Death will not be dispelled if either of the two affected champions enter resurrection after taking lethal damage. It is dispelled if the target enters a zombie state.
  * Any active tether effects (both friendly and hostile ones) existing on either of the two champions entering the realm are broken (unless the tether is between those two).
  * Upon entering the realm, Mordekaiser and the target are cleansed from all forced action effects. (bug)
  * Unlike other stats, Mordekaiser does not steal enemy total size; instead, he gains 10% of his own size and reduces the enemy's size by 10% of theirs (all size modifiers stack additively).
  * Mordekaiser grows in size over 0.25 seconds after successfully stealing his targets' stats, and shrinks over 0.25 seconds after the buff runs out again. The target shrinks over 0.25 seconds after their stats are stolen, but grows back to normal size instantly when the effect ends.
* **Map-Specific Differences**
  * Nexus Blitz differences
    * When certain Events begin, both Mordekaiser and his target immediately leave the Death Realm.
