Colossal Smash

STATIC
COOLDOWN: 5s
EFFECT RADIUS: 250

Innate: Galio's next basic attack is empowered to have an uncancellable windup, gain 40% bonus attack speed, and deal modified magic damage to the target and all enemies near them. Whenever Galio hits at least one enemy champion or epic monster with an ability, Colossal Smash's cooldown is reduced by 3 seconds. This may occur only once per cast. Colossal Smash can critically strike for (75% + 50%) AD bonus magic damage to all targets hit.

SPEED: 1400 / 50

Active: Galio creates two windblasts 250 units to either side of him that arc out before converging to the target location, dealing magic damage to all enemies they pass through. Upon impact, the gusts form a tornado that persists for 2 seconds, slowly moving forward and dealing magic damage equal to 2.5% (+ 1% per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health every 0.5 seconds to enemies within the area, capped at 150 per tick against monsters, and 600 total against champions. Winds of War will cast at max range if cast beyond that.

Recast: Galio refreshes the damage reduction for 2 seconds and deals magic damage to nearby enemy champions, increased by 0% - 200% (based on channel time), as well as taunts them for 0.5 - 1.5 (based on channel time) seconds during which their movement speed is set to a static 60 for the same duration.

Minimum Magic Damage: 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 (+ 30% AP)
Maximum Magic Damage: 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 (+ 90% AP)

Outside the gleaming city of Demacia, the stone colossus Galio keeps vigilant watch. Built as a bulwark against enemy mages, he often stands motionless for decades until the presence of powerful magic stirs him to life. Once activated, Galio makes the most of his time, savoring the thrill of a fight and the rare honor of defending his countrymen. But his triumphs are always bittersweet, for the magic he destroys is also his source of reanimation, and each victory leaves him dormant once again.

Sensing a shift in the marketability of Hextech items, several of Piltover's largest industrial families pooled resources to create Galio, a massive golem donated to the city and her people. While he is ostensibly a walking advertisement, the protective creature is both curious about the world, and proud of his responsibility.

One of the great dukes of Hell, Galio stands before his kingdom's black gates as the judge of all sinners, casting souls into their proper torments. Attempting to invoke him generally ends in tragedy, as he's several hundred feet tall and refuses to shrink in the service of mortals.
