The movement speed from Serpentine Grace is worth 48 per level, up to a maximum of 864 at level 18.

Without other movement speed modifiers taken into account, Serpentine Grace grants Cassiopeia a total of 332 − 400 (based on level) movement speed.

As Predator and Magical Footwear require boots, they will be replaced with Electrocute and Triple Tonic, respectively.

Noxious Blast always uses quick cast, regardless of player settings.

The damage inflicted by Noxious Blast is calculated as follows: damage / 7 ticks rounded down to the nearest integer.

For example: with 0 bonus AP, Noxious Blast inflicts 75 damages over 7 ticks of damage, so 75/7 (≈10.71) deals first of all 10 damage, then (2 × 75/7) ≈ 11.43 deals in a second time 11 damages, then (3 × 75/7) ≈ 11.14 deals in a third time 11 damages, and so on.

The damage displayed for Noxious Blast DOT (Damage\_over\_time) always remains constant and corresponds to the previously mentioned formula: damage / 7 ticks rounded down to the nearest integer. It's important not to confuse the consistent displayed damage with the actual damage, which is updated with each tick, see tick and updates.

With the same example as above, the damage displayed is always 10.

Occasionally, Noxious Blast may not deal the displayed damage. This discrepancy occurs when the calculated damage falls between 0.5 and 1. In such cases, rounding to the nearest integer, specifically rounding up, creates a 1-point difference. It's important to note that the damage is rounded down to the nearest integer.

For example: with a Blasting Wand's, Noxious Blast shows 116 magic damage, but really deals using the formula above 115 magic damage.

(bug)

When Cassiopeia has precisely 20 or 40 bonus AP, Noxious Blast may inflict 1 less damage than intended. Importantly, this bug occurs independently of rounding considerations.

PENDING FOR TEST:

Enemies within the blast of Noxious Blast are poisoned for something between 3.
2
and 3.
3
seconds.

Upon reaching the target, Twin Fang waits for an ongoing Noxious Blast to explode before dealing its damage.

Twin Fang's damage against poisoned targets:

When maxed first: 72 − 220 (based on level) (+ 70% AP) .

When maxed second: 72 − 220 (based on level) (+ 70% AP) .

When maxed last: 72 − 220 (based on level) (+ 70% AP) .

Twin Fang's cast indicator is incorrectly adding her own radius to the range like an edge range ability, and therefore slightly larger than the actual cast range.

If the target becomes untargetable, dies, or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).

Cassiopeia is a deadly creature bent on manipulating others to her sinister will. Youngest and most beautiful daughter of the noble Du Couteau family of Noxus, she ventured deep into the crypts beneath Shurima in search of ancient power. There, she was bitten by a gruesome tomb guardian, whose venom transformed her into a viper-like predator. Cunning and agile, Cassiopeia now slithers under the veil of night, petrifying her enemies with her baleful gaze.

On a cliff overlooking the sea, the lonely gorgon Cassiopeia has made her home among a garden of statues of her own making. Memories of friends, enemies, and lovers passed, immortalized in stone, many eternally screaming in agony. Whispers from the local villages warn not to enter her domain, but still, visitors keep coming, all to meet the same fate.

So great was her beauty, and so renowned her cunning, that a shrine was built to honor this 'spirit of temptation', until her story was accepted into popular folklore.

Trivia

Cassiopeia was the last champion released in 2010 as well as the third one to feature an 'Art Spotlight' (hers in particular shows how her taunt was animated).

Cassiopeia's basic attack particles were snakes at release, as seen in her Champion Spotlight.

Cassiopeia - Katarina is one of seven pairs of sibling champions (the others being Kayle-Morgana, Garen-Lux, Nasus-Renekton, Yasuo-Yone, Darius-Draven, and Vi-Jinx).

Though not a pair, Anivia, Ornn, and Volibear are also siblings.

Twin Fang directly benefits from allied poison abilities in the same fashion Last Breath does with displacement ones.

Her name's first element derives from Hebrew קְצִיעָה qeṣiah cassia: Possibly from Semitic root K-S "cut", as the barks were scrapped from the tree's trunk; or borrowed from Old Chinese 桂 *kʷeːs (> Mandarin guì /kʷei̯˥˩/) "osmanthus fragrans", by spice-merchants who imported the barks; the suffix -opeia is etymologically uncertain.

The inspiration for Cassiopeia comes from mainly three sources: Greek mythology She shares names with the eponymous constellation charted by Ptolemy as well as the eponymous queen from Greek Mythology. Miasma references the eponymous mythical disease. She resembles a Gorgon (with Petrifying Gaze and her death animation referencing Medusa) as well as a Drakaina. Hellenised Ptolemaic Egypt Her seductress background references Cleopatra VII. Hers is the the Belly Dance. Indian Nāgini.
