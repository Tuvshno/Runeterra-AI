        1. **Concussive Blows**
           * Passive:
            1. Braum's basic attacks and Winter's Bite each apply a stack of Concussive Blows to their target for 4 seconds.
            2. Once the first stack has been applied, any allied champion's basic attack on the target generates an additional stack.
            3. The fourth stack against a target consumes all stacks, dealing 26 - 196 (based on level) magic damage and stunning them for 1.25 - 1.75 (based on level) seconds.
            4. This effect cannot apply to the same target more than once every few seconds.
            5. During the immunity period, affected targets instead take 20% of the trigger damage as bonus magic damage from Braum's basic attacks and Winter's Bite.

           * Active: Braum propels ice from his shield in the target direction, dealing magic damage to the first enemy hit and slowing them by 70% decaying over 2 seconds.

           * Cooldown: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 seconds
           * Active: Braum dashes to put himself between the target ally and the closest enemy champion within 1500 units, granting himself and the ally bonus armor and bonus magic resistance for 3 seconds.
