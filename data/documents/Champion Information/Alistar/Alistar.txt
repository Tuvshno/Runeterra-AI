**Triumphant Roar**

**Triumphant Roar**

**STATIC**

**COOLDOWN:** 3

**EFFECT RADIUS:** 1000/950

**Innate:**

Alistar generates a stack of Triumph for each enemy champion he stuns or displaces with his abilities, and each time a nearby enemy minion or non-epic monster dies. He generates 7 stacks if a nearby enemy champion or epic monster dies.

At 7 stacks, Alistar consumes them all to heal himself for 5% of his maximum health and nearby allied champions for 7% of his maximum health.

Triumphant Roar can occur only once every few seconds, though Alistar may still generate stacks before then.

**Details**

* If Alistar is at 7 stacks when Triumphant Roar comes off cooldown, he will roar as soon as it elapses.
* Alistar does not gain stacks for unsuccessfully trying to apply crowd control, for instance against a crowd control immune target.
* Alistar will still gain a stack for unsuccessfully trying to knock back a champion protected by a spell shield with Headbutt.
* Healing occurs simultaneously for Alistar and his allies.
* There is a VFX projectile (700 missile speed) that cannot be destroyed by Wind Wall and is unrelated to the actual heal.
* Alistar loses all Triumph stacks upon dying.

**Pulverize**

**Pulverize**

**COST:** 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 mana

**COOLDOWN:** 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10

**CAST TIME:** 0.25/0.15

**EFFECT RADIUS:** 375

**Active:**

Alistar smashes the ground, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies and stunning and knocking them up simultaneously for 1 second.

Magic Damage: 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 (+ 80% AP)

**Details**

* Pulverize can be buffered during Headbutt to cast with reduced cast time when the dash ends.
* Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the stun.
* This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
* Video: <https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Alistar_Q_Video.webm>

**Edit**

**Headbutt**

**Headbutt**

**COST:** 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 mana

**COOLDOWN:** 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10

**CAST TIME:** none

**TARGET RANGE:** 650

**SPEED:** 1200 / 1544 / ∞

**Active:**

Alistar dashes to the target enemy's location. If they are within 400 units upon arrival, he deals them magic damage and knocks them back 700 units over 0.5 seconds while also stunning them for 0.75 seconds.

Magic Damage: 55 / 110 / 165 / 220 / 275 (+ 100% AP)

**Tips & Tricks**

* Map-Specific Differences
* Ultra Rapid Fire differences: Stun now ends at the same time the displacement does.
* Arena differences: Cooldown changed to 26 / 23.5 / 21 / 18.5 / 16 seconds.
* Video: <https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Alistar_W_Video.mp4>

**Edit**

**Trample**

**Trample**

**COST:** 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 mana

**COOLDOWN:** 12 / 11.5 / 11 / 10.5 / 10

**CAST TIME:** none

**EFFECT RADIUS:** 350

**Active:**

Alistar tramples the ground around him every 0.5 seconds over 5 seconds, becoming ghosted and dealing magic damage to nearby enemies. Each time this damages at least one enemy champion, he generates a stack of Trample that lasts for the remaining duration, stacking up to 5 times.

Magic Damage Per Tick: 8 / 11 / 14 / 17 / 20 (+ 7% AP)

Total Magic Damage: 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 / 200 (+ 70% AP)

At 5 stacks, Alistar's next basic attack against a champion within 6 seconds is empowered to deal 20 − 275 (based on level) bonus magic damage and stun the target for 1 second. This will end Trample prematurely.

**Details**

* Trample deals persistent area damage damage around Alistar, while the bonus damage on the resulting attack is proc damage.
* The stun and bonus damage are blocked by spell shields but the base attack damage is not.
* The on-hit effect is consumed if the attack is blocked, but not if it is dodged or missed while Alistar is blinded. In all cases, the attack's effects are negated as normal.
* As it is an on-hit effect, the bonus damage and stun can be applied by Guinsoo's Rageblade's Phantom Hit.

**Unbreakable Will**

**Unbreakable Will**

**COST:** 100 mana

**COOLDOWN:** 120 / 100 / 80

* Ultra Rapid Fire differences: Duration changed to 3.5 seconds.
* Arena differences: Cooldown changed to 180 / 150 / 120 seconds.

Always a mighty warrior with a fearsome reputation, Alistar seeks revenge for the death of his clan at the hands of the Noxian empire. Though he was enslaved and forced into the life of a gladiator, his unbreakable will was what kept him from truly becoming a beast. Now, free of the chains of his former masters, he fights in the name of the downtrodden and the disadvantaged, his rage as much a weapon as his horns, hooves and fists.

* Trivia
	+ [2] Alistar is voiced by Harlan Hogan.
	+ Alistar is an alternative form of Alasdair, the Anglicized form of Scottish Gaelic Alasdair, ultimately from Ancient Greek Ἀλέξανδρος, meaning "Defender": from PIE roots *h₂lek- "to ward off, to defend" and *h₂nḗr "man".
	+ During Alpha Test, he was simply called 'Minotaur'.
	+ Alistar was deemed overpowered/obnoxious in the Ultra Rapid Fire game mode (available in April 2014) and was ultimately disabled in non-custom games.
	+ Alistar's Series 1 Eternals make the following references: By the Horns references the phrase take the bull by the horns. Indomita-Bull is a pun on the words indomitable and bull. Matador is another term for bullfighter.
