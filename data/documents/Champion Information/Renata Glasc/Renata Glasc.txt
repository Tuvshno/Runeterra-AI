        ***Abilities***
        **Leverage (Passive)**
        - Innate: Renata's basic attacks mark enemies for 6 seconds, refreshing on subsequent hits and expiring when attacking a new enemy
        - If the enemy was unmarked, her attack deals bonus magic damage equal to 1% - 2% (based on level) (+ 2% per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health
        - Allied champions' damaging attacks and abilities against marked targets consume the mark to deal additional bonus magic damage equal to 1% - 2% (based on level) (+ 2% per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health
        - Leverage's damage is capped at 150 against monsters
        - Counters: Spell shield
        - Note: Spell shield does not block the mark's application

        **Handshake (Q)**
        - Cost: 80 Mana
        - Cooldown: 16 seconds
        - Cast Time: 0.25 seconds
        - Range: 900 / 275, Width: 140, Speed: 1450 / X, Tether Radius: 1200
        - Active: Renata fires a hook in the target direction that deals magic damage to the first enemy hit and roots them for 1 second, during which they are revealed
        - If the root is applied, Renata forms a tether between herself and the target for the same duration, causing her to become unable to declare attacks and have her movement speed reduced by 30%
        - Magic Damage: 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+ 80% AP)
        - Recast: Renata breaks the tether to knock the target in the target direction, though not through terrain, dealing the same damage to enemies they pass through
        - If the thrown target is a champion, all secondary targets hit are stunned for 0.5 seconds
        - Counters: Spell shield
        - Note 1: The tether's duration lasts the same as the root duration, even if it is modified by tenacity
        - Note 2: The root is removed if the target is untethered, but the tether is not removed unless the target is killed or the ability is recast
        - Note 3: Spell shield blocks the hook but not the recast's effects as the primary target
        - Note 4: Renata may still move while the hook is in flight
        - Note 5: Her facing direction is locked towards the target direction of the hook
        - Note 6: The movement speed reduction stacks additively with other movement speed bonuses
        - Note 7: This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time

        - Active: Renata infuses herself or the target allied champion with a chemtech formula for 5 seconds, granting the target bonus attack speed and bonus movement speed while they are facing nearby visible enemy champions and minions
        - The duration resets whenever the target scores a takedown against an enemy champion within 6 seconds of damaging them
        - Bonus Attack Speed: 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30% (+ 1% per 100 AP)

        - Bonus Movement Speed: 10 / 12.5 / 15 / 17.5 / 20% (+ 1% per 100 AP)
        - Maximum Bonus Movement Speed: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40% (+ 2% per 100 AP)
        - If the target takes fatal damage while Bailout is active, they are restored to 100% of their maximum health but suffer a true damage burn equal to 10% of their maximum health every 0.256 seconds until they die from reaching 0 health
        - During this time, if they score a takedown against an enemy champion within 6 seconds of damaging them, the burn is stopped prematurely and their current health is set to 20% of their maximum health
        - This effect may only occur once per application of Bailout while the target already has the buff and is not burning
