### Abilities

[ **Battle Fury** ]
[ **Bloodlust** ]
[ **Mocking Shout** ]
[ **Spinning Slash** ]
[ **Undying Rage** ]

#### Battle Fury

- **Innate**: Tryndamere generates 5 Fury on his basic attacks, and 10 Fury on critical strikes and each time he kills an enemy. After 8 seconds without dealing or taking damage, Tryndamere loses 5 Fury per second. Tryndamere gains 0% − 40% (based on Fury) critical strike chance.
- **Details**: Fury generation stacks additively: if the given action triggers multiple ways of generating Fury, all of them apply. Killing an enemy with a basic attack generates 15 Fury (5 Fury from the basic attack + 10 Fury from the kill). Killing an enemy with a critical strike generates 20 Fury (10 Fury from the critical strike + 10 Fury from the kill). The Fury gain for killing an enemy also stacks with Spinning Slash's Fury generation per enemy hit. Attacks against structures will not grant bonus Fury, but will still reset the timer on Fury decay. Attacks against wards behave like attacks on normal enemies, generating 5 Fury and resetting the decay timer. Attacks against wards can critically strike, generating 10 Fury. Attacks against jungle plants will generate 5 Fury and reset the decay timer. Attacking an Honeyfruit and collecting the pods generates 30 Fury, or 35 Fury if the plant was hit by a critical strike. Fury is only granted if the basic attack hits and will not be granted if Tryndamere cancels his basic attack windup.

#### Bloodlust

- **Cost**: 100% Current Fury, Cooldown: 12 seconds, Cast Time: none
- **Passive**: Tryndamere gains bonus attack damage, plus an additional amount based on his missing health.
- **Details**: Map-Specific Differences: Arena differences: Fury generation changed to 150%, Base heal changed to 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 / 140, Heal AP ratio changed to 50% AP, Heal per 1 Fury changed to 1 / 1.75 / 2.5 / 3.25 / 4, Heal per 1 Fury AP ratio changed to 2% AP.

#### Mocking Shout

- **Cost**: 14 seconds, Cast Time: 0.3 seconds, Effect Radius: 850
- **Passive**: Tryndamere reduces the attack damage of nearby enemy champions for 4 seconds. Targets facing in the opposite direction of Tryndamere are also slowed for the duration.
- **Details**: Map-Specific Differences: Targeting input: Auto, Counters: Spell shield (blocked), Mocking Shout very briefly reveals Tryndamere if he uses it while in the fog of war to enemies. Map-Specific Differences: Arena differences: Slow strength changed to 50 / 57.5 / 65 / 72.5 / 80%, Attack damage reduction changed to 30 / 52.5 / 75 / 97.5 / 120, Slow: 30 / 37.5 / 45 / 52.5 / 60%.

#### Spinning Slash

- **Cost**: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 seconds, Cast Time: none, Target Range: 660, Effect Radius: 225
- **Active**: Tryndamere dashes to the target location, dealing physical damage to enemies hit and generating 2 Fury per enemy hit, increased to 5 Fury against champions. Physical Damage: 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 / 200 (+ 130% bonus AD) (+ 80% AP). Critical strikes reduce Spinning Slash's current cooldown by 0.75 seconds, doubled to 1.5 seconds against champions. Bloodlust and Undying Rage can be cast during the dash. Spinning Slash will cast at max range if cast beyond that.
- **Details**: Map-Specific Differences: Fury generation stacks additively with Battle Fury's Fury generation on kill, Killing a minion with Spinning Slash grants 12 Fury (2 Fury from enemy hit + 10 Fury from the kill), Killing a champion with Spinning Slash grants 15 Fury (5 Fury from champion hit + 10 Fury from the kill), There is no cooldown on Fury generation on kill with Spinning Slash, Spinning Slash has no minimum dash range, Flash will interrupt the dash but Spinning Slash will deal damage to enemies at the new location instantly, Enemies already hit by Spinning Slash cannot be damaged more than once, To ensure Spinning Slash deals damage when dashing away from an enemy champion, Tryndamere needs to move r-35 units towards the enemy beyond the distance he can basic attack at, where r represents the enemy's radius and 35 is the distance in units beyond Tryndamere's basic attack range that Spinning Slash can reach, The cooldown reduction upon critically striking triggers on wards and jungle plants, The cooldown reduction upon critically striking triggers even if the attack is blocked, Pending for Test: Cooldown reduction on critical strike interaction with parrying effects (dodge, blind).

#### Undying Rage

- **Cost**: 120 / 100 / 80 seconds, Cast Time: none
- **Active**: Tryndamere becomes enraged, instantly gaining Fury and a minimum health threshold for 5 seconds.
- **Details**: Map-Specific Differences: No additional notes.
