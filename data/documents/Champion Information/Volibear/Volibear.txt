**The Relentless Storm**

**EFFECT RADIUS:**

450

**Innate:**

Whenever

Volibear

damages at least one enemy with a

basic attack

or

ability

, he generates a

stack

of

The Relentless Storm

for 6 seconds, refreshing on subsequent damage and stacking up to 5 times. At 5 stacks,

Volibear

gains

Lightning Claws

.

**The Relentless Storm:**

For each stack,

Volibear

gains

5%

(+ 4% per 100 AP)

bonus

attack speed

, up to

25%

(+ 20% per 100 AP)

.

**Lightning Claws:**

Volibear's

claws ignite with lightning, empowering his basic attacks
on-hit
to deal
11 − 60 (based on level)
(+ 50% AP)
bonus
magic damage
to the target and the nearest
visible
enemy within 450 units of the target, chaining up to 4 subsequent targets.

Volibear's

stacks.

Stacks of

The Relentless Storm

are also granted

on-hit

, but will specifically not be if the target is

invulnerable

.

While at four stacks, the next attack or ability on-hit reaching the fifth stack will be empowered by

Lightning Claws

.

A stack of

The Relentless Storm

is not gained if the attack is

dodged

and/or missed if

Volibear

is

blinded

. A stack is granted even if the attack is

blocked

. In all cases,

Lightning Claws

will not apply (on-hit damage is parried and the bounce is prevented).

Since

Frenzied Maul

cannot be missed while

Volibear

is

blinded

, gaining stacks from

The Relentless Storm

and applying

Lighting Claws

from the ability will not be prevented from that parry effect.

Volibear

has a hidden passive that grants him

1 armor

for every enemy

Zilean

within 800 range of him.

Likewise,

Zilean

gains

1 ability power

for every nearby

Volibear

.

Neither

Volibear

nor

Zilean

need

sight

of one another to gain these bonuses.

The empowered attacks do not affect

nor

To those who still revere him, the Volibear is the storm made manifest. Destructive, wild, and stubbornly resolute, he existed before mortals walked the Freljord's tundra, and is fiercely protective of the lands that he and his demi-god kin created. Cultivating a deep hatred of civilization and the weakness it brought with it, he now fights to return to the old ways—when the land was untamed, and blood spilled freely—and eagerly battles all who oppose him, with tooth, claw, and thundering domination.

In an age before man, King Voli ruled the bitter northlands, and he was as harsh and unforgiving as they were. It is said that he waged a terrible war against his brother, the great King Ornn, and that their struggle razed mountains and emptied seas, as the two of them became like beasts themselves.

Even so, he and Constable Trundle always end up patrolling the streets with mountains of paperwork left in their wake.

Volibear was the greatest terror in the forest, until the nearby volcano erupted. In the frenzy of escape, Volibear came across a child who was similarly trapped, and heeded a strange instinct—he saved the child. The Duality Dragon saw and made the mighty predator an offer: the power to hone the duality of his nature, both fury and compassion.
