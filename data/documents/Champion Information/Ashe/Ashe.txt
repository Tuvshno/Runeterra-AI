**Frost Shot**

* Passive
* Damage type: Sub-type: Physical
* Counters: Spell shield, Parries, Blocked: Blocked

**Description**

Ashe's basic attacks and ability hits apply Frost to enemies, slowing them by 20% - 30% (based on level) for 2 seconds. Basic attacks against enemies with Frost are modified to deal 120% (75% + 50%) of critical strike chance damage.

---

**Ranger's Focus**

* Passive: While Ranger's Focus is inactive, Ashe's basic attacks on-attack generate a stack of Focus for 4 seconds, which refreshes on subsequent attacks and stacks up to 4 times. Stacks expire by one every 1 second.
* Active: For 6 seconds, Ashe gains bonus attack speed and empowers her basic attacks to fire a flurry of five arrows. Bonus attack speed: 25 / 32.5 / 40.5 / 47.5 / 55%, each arrow deals modified physical damage that benefits from Frost Shot and life steal. The flurry resets Ashe's basic attack timer.

---

**Volley**

* Active
* Damage type: Type: Area damage, Sub-type: Physical
* Counters: Spell shield, Projectile, Blocked: Blocked, Blocked

**Description**

Ashe shoots a volley of arrows in a cone in the target direction, each dealing physical damage to the first enemy hit and applying Critical Slow to enemy champions hit. Arrows: 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 / 11, Physical Damage: 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80 (+ 100% AD). Enemies can intercept multiple arrows but do not take damage from any beyond the first.

---

* Arena: Base damage changed to 25 / 45 / 65 / 85 / 105, AD ratio changed to 120% AD.

---

**Hawkshot**

* Active
* Damage type: Type: Damage, Sub-type: N/A
* Counters: Spell shield, Projectile, Not Blocked

**Description**

Ashe sends a hawk spirit toward the target location, granting sight of the area along its path for 0.5 seconds after every 100 units traveled and at its destination for 5 seconds. Hawkshot periodically stocks a charge, up to a maximum of 2, and the recharge timer starts from 0 when the ability is ranked.

---

**Enchanted Crystal Arrow**

* Active
* Damage type: Type: Magic, Sub-type: N/A
* Counters: N/A

**Description**

Ashe fires a massive arrow of ice in the target direction, granting sight of the area it flies through each for 1 second. The arrow shatters upon hitting an enemy champion, dealing magic damage and stunning them for 1 - 3.5 (based on distance traveled) seconds and granting sight of the area around them for 1 second. Magic Damage: 200 / 400 / 600 (+ 120% AP). Enemies surrounding the primary target are dealt 50% damage and afflicted with Frost Shot. Reduced Damage: 100 / 200 / 300 (+ 60% AP).

**Trivia**

[2] Ashe's dance references J'en Ai Marre! by Alizée. A side by side comparison can be seen here.

[3] Ashe shares similarities with Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca from Final Fantasy XII. Their names are similar and both became queens, use ranged weapons (Ashelia uses hand bombs in Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings) and were once hunted down to prevent them from leading their respective peoples.

[4] Ashe is the first (and so far the only) champion to possess two global-ranged abilities: Hawkshot and Enchanted Crystal Arrow.

[5] Ashe was named for Marc 'Tryndamere' Merrill's wife Ashley.

[6] As of December 9, 2017 Ashe has featured on the free champion rotation more than any other champion (76 times).

[7] In Summoner's Rift, Thornmail was once recommended as a situational item for Ashe, this was most likely a reference to the old Basic Tutorial where Ashe is pre-selected as the player's champion and Thornmail is the only purchasable item.

[8] In the now-removed official League of Legends forums, the icon of Focus was used to represent the "New Player Forum" section.
