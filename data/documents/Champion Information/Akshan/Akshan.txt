		* V11.15: Avengerang (Q) added: Active: Akshan hurls a boomerang in the target direction, dealing 5 / 25 / 45 / 65 / 85 (+ 80% AD) physical damage to enemies hit and revealing them for 1 second, granting sight of the area along its path, as well as extending its range every time it hits an enemy. If the boomerang hits an enemy champion, Akshan gains 40% bonus movement speed decaying over 1 second. Upon reaching maximum range, the boomerang returns to Akshan. Enemies can be hit once per pass. Avengerang's deals 40 / 47.5 / 55 / 62.5 / 70% damage against non-champions. Mana Cost: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80, Cooldown: 8 / 7.5 / 7 / 6.5 / 6 seconds, Range: 850, Effect Radius: 400, Width: 120, Speed: 1500 / 2400, Cast time: 0.25 seconds.
		* V11.15: Going Rogue (W) added: Passive: Enemy champions that kill allied champions are marked as a Scoundrel for 60 seconds. Upon scoring a takedown against a Scoundrel within 3 seconds of damaging them, Akshan receives an additional 100 and revives all dead allied champions that were slain by that enemy champion after 1 second at their summoning platform, and removes the marks from all other enemies. Active: Akshan enters camouflage, which lasts for 2 seconds or indefinitely while he is near terrain or inside brush. Going Rogue can be recast after 1 second, and does so automatically at the end of its duration. Attacking or casting abilities ends Going Rogue immediately. While Going Rogue and moving towards nearby Scoundrels, Akshan gains 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 / 120 bonus movement speed and bonus mana regeneration equal to 12% of his missing mana. Recast: Akshan ends Going Rogue. Mana Cost: 40 / 30 / 20 / 10 / 0, Cooldown: 18 / 14 / 10 / 6 / 2 seconds. Detection Radius: 800, Cast time: 0.5 seconds.
		* V11.15: Heroic Swing (E) added: Active: Akshan can activate Heroic Swing three times before the ability goes on cooldown, and can use the third cast only after 0.5 seconds of the second cast. Akshan may input a movement command to use the second and third casts. First Cast: Akshan fires a hook in the target direction, which grapples to the first instance of terrain hit for 1.5 seconds. Heroic Swing's second cast can be used while the hook is attached. If Akshan becomes immobilized or grounded during this time, the hook will detach, ending Heroic Swing prematurely. Second Cast: Akshan swings around the terrain, rapidly firing at the nearest visible enemy to deal them 30 / 55 / 80 / 105 / 130 (+ 10% bonus AD) (+ 30% bonus attack speed) physical damage per shot and apply on-hit and on-attack effects at 25% effectiveness per shot. He stops the swing upon colliding with an enemy champion or terrain, or after 3 seconds. Akshan will be knocked down by any immobilizing crowd control during the dash. Third Cast: Akshan jumps off of the rope to the target location and fires one last shot at a nearby visible enemy. Heroic Swing's cooldown resets upon scoring a takedown against an enemy champion. The shots benefit from critical strike modifiers at 90% effectiveness and apply life steal at 100% effectiveness. Akshan prioritizes firing at enemy champions with stacks of Dirty Fighting, will not fire if he is channeling Comeuppance, and reveals himself during Heroic Swing. Mana Cost: 70, Cooldown: 18 / 16.5 / 15 / 13.5 / 12 seconds. Speed: 2500 / 1200, Cast time: None.
		* V11.15: Comeuppance (R) added: Active: Akshan channels for 2.5 seconds, locking onto the target enemy champion, revealing them, and storing 5 / 6 / 7 bullets into his weapon, as well as revealing himself. Comeuppance can be recast after 0.5 seconds during the channel, and does so automatically at the end of its duration. Comeuppance is placed on a 15-second cooldown if its channel is canceled. Recast: Akshan fires all stored bullets at the target, each dealing 20 / 25 / 30 (+ 10% AD) physical damage to the first enemy hit, including structures, and increased by 0% − 300% (based on target's missing health). Each bullet's damage is also increased by 0.5% per 1% critical strike chance and critical damage bonuses at 50% effectiveness, applies life steal at 80% effectiveness, and executes minions. Akshan may still move and cast Heroic Swing while channeling Comeuppance. Mana Cost: 100, Cooldown: 100 / 85 / 70 seconds. Target Range: 2500, Width: 120, Speed: 3200, Cast time: None.
