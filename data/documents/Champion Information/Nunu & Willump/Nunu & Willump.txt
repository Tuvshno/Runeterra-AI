* Abilities
  + [Call of the Freljord]
    - TARGET IMMUNITY: 10
    - TARGET RANGE: 1000 / 700
    - Innate: When Nunu and Willump deal damage against an enemy champion, large monster, or structure, they and a nearby allied champion gain Call of the Freljord for 4 seconds, prioritizing the ally with the highest attack speed.
    - Call of the Freljord: Grants 20% bonus attack speed and 10% bonus movement speed to the caster and nearby allied champion. Willump's basic attacks deal 30% AD physical damage to secondary targets in a cone in front of him. Nunu and Willump cannot trigger Call of the Freljord from the same enemy again for a time. Successive triggers of Call of the Freljord while it is active extend the duration by 4 seconds.
  + [Consume]
    - COST: 60 Mana
    - COOLDOWN: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 seconds
    - CAST TIME: 0.3 seconds
    - TARGET RANGE: 125
    - Active: Willump takes a bite out of the target enemy, dealing damage and healing himself. The heal is increased by 50% while he is below 50% maximum health. Against minions and monsters, he deals true damage. Consume's heal is reduced to 60% against champions.
  + [Biggest Snowball Ever!]

    - TARGET RANGE: 750 - 1750 (based on charge time)
    - SPEED: 350
    - Size Radius: 75 - 200 (based on charge time)
    - Active: Willump cleanses himself from all slows and channels for up to 10 seconds, becoming ghosted and slow-immune and creating a rolling snowball. Willump automatically navigates his movement in the direction of the cursor and can steer the snowball with a slow turn rate that increases over time, resetting upon changing direction. The duo has their movement speed reduced by 50% for the first second, but after a delay, they start gaining 14 movement speed every 0.25 seconds, up to a cap. The snowball increases in size and power over 5 seconds. Biggest Snowball Ever! can be recast after 0.5 seconds during the channel, and does so automatically after the channel or if interrupted. The snowball explodes upon hitting an enemy champion, large pet, medium/large monster, or terrain, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies, increased by 0% - 400% (based on charge time), knocking them up for 0.5 - 0.75 seconds (based on charge time), and subsequently stunning them for 0 - 0.5 seconds (based on charge time). Minimum magic damage: 36 / 45 / 54 / 63 / 72 (+ 30% AP). Maximum magic damage: 180 / 225 / 270 / 315 / 360 (+ 150% AP).

    - CAST TIME: None
    - TARGET RANGE: 690
    - Barrage Cooldown: 1 second (affected by cooldown reduction)
    - Active: Nunu swiftly throws a volley of 3 snowballs in the target direction over 0.4 seconds that each shatter upon hitting an enemy, dealing magic damage to enemies in a cone. Magic damage per hit: 16 / 24 / 32 / 40 / 48 (+ 15% AP). Total magic damage: 48 / 72 / 96 / 120 / 144 (+ 45% AP). Enemies hit 3 times are slowed for 1 second. Champions and large monsters hit once are marked Snowbound for 4 seconds, refreshing on each hit. Snowball Barrage can be recast twice within 3 seconds at no additional cost and with a cooldown in between casts. Slow: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50%. Recast: Nunu hurls another volley of snowballs, mimicking the first cast's effects. An enemy may only be slowed once for being hit by snowballs. Maximum total magic damage: 144 / 216 / 288 / 360 / 432 (+ 135% AP). After 3 seconds from the first cast, Snowbound enemies near Willump take magic damage and are rooted for 0.5 - 1.5 seconds (based on level). Magic damage: 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 (+ 80% AP).

    - CAST TIME: None
    - EFFECT RADIUS: 650
    - Active: Nunu and Willump channel a blizzard for up to 3 seconds, granting themselves a shield and slowing nearby enemies by 0% - 95% (based on channel time). Shield strength: 65 / 75 / 85 (+ 150% AP) (+ 30 / 40 / 50% bonus health). Absolute Zero can be recast after 0.5 seconds during the channel, and does so automatically when the channel ends by any means. Recast: Nunu and Willump explode, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies, modified to 0% - 100% (based on channel time), and slowing them for 0 - 3 seconds (based on channel time). Affected enemies will remain slowed for 0 - 3 seconds (based on channel time), and any of the duo's remaining shield will decay over 3 seconds. Magic damage: 625 / 950 / 1275 (+ 300% AP).
