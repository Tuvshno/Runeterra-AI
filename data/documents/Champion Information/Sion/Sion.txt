**Abilities**

Edit

* Glory in Death
* Death Surge

**Glory in Death**

Innate:

* Upon taking fatal damage, Sion enters stasis for 1.5 seconds to reanimate into a frenzy, restoring 100% of his maximum health but losing 2.3 - 24.4 (based on level) health every 0.264 seconds, increasing by 70% of the base value per subsequent tick.
* Sion's health regeneration and any healing (except life steal) he receives during this time is 0% effective.
* Sion can only move and use his basic attacks and item actives, and empowers himself with the following effects:
	+ 75 attack speed minimum and maximum
	+ 100% life steal
	+ Deals bonus physical damage on-hit equal to 10% of the target's maximum health, capped at 75 against non-champions

**Death Surge**

COOLDOWN: 100

Active:

* Sion gains 67% bonus movement speed (bug) that decays over 2.376 seconds.
* Once at least one ability has been learned, Death Surge can be cast using any ability key, even for the abilities that haven't been learned yet.

---

**Glory in Death Details**

* Sion's death timer starts when he dies and not when Glory in Death ends.
* If Sion lives longer than what his death timer lasts for, he will not revive until Glory in Death has ended. When it ends, he instantly revives. This may result in some odd interactions and bugs at times.
* The effect that heals Sion back to full health at the start of Glory in Death cannot be modified by healing reductions and does not count towards the 'Damage Healed' statistic at the end of game lobby.
* The health loss is unaffected by Invulnerability.
* Glory in Death has a capped 60 seconds duration. If the player manages to survive for so long, Sion dies instantly, regardless of his current health.
* The healing modifier during Glory in Death reduces all incoming healing, it does not matter if they are sourced from Sion himself or an ally. This does not affect life steal.
* This healing modifier stacks additively with Spirit Visage and does not stack with heal and shield power.
* The fixed attack speed is achieved by lowering and increasing the maximum and minimum attack speed to 1.75, respectively.
* This also means that it's unaffected by other attack speed modifiers for the duration, such as bonus attack speed or cripples.
* However, Hail of Blades, which allows for the normal attack speed cap (2.5) to be surpassed, will also break this limit. This means that while it is active, Sion may exceed his 1.75 cap, but cannot fall below it.
* This does not apply to Lethal Tempo.
* Some item passive do not persist through death and will be lost for the initial few seconds of Glory in Death.
* Phase Rush cooldown is reset upon entering Glory in Death.
* The bonus on-hit damage granted by Glory in Death is unaffected by life steal, but is applied against structures that are not turrets.
* However, it can be applied against structures that are not turrets.
* (bug) Sion, during Glory in Death, will not lose health while being carried by Fate's Call.
* Glory in Death does not trigger on clones of Sion, such as with Test of Spirit.
* Glory in Death's untargetability from the stasis does not destroy in-flight projectiles.
* Projectiles created while Sion is in the zombie form will still travel to him even after he dies.
* Upon death, the current cooldowns of Sion's summoner spells are increased to 4 seconds. Afterwards, he is still unable to use them until he respawns.
* However, it is possible for another lock-out effect to unlock them when their duration ends (excluding crowd control with the exception of stasis).
* After Glory in Death ends, the corpse of Sion will retain unit collision despite being dead on the ground.
* Buffs from jungle monsters that Sion acquired during Glory in Death will not be lost when the duration ends (Crest of Cinders, Crest of Insight).

---

**Interactions & Other**

* By surviving for the full duration of 60 seconds, Sion will have suffered 41.8 (based on level) - 443.7 (based on level) in health costs.
* Sion can also heal from spell vamp, although the stat is currently unobtainable and it would be also unusable during Glory in Death, since there would be no available abilities that would apply it.
* Even though its visuals are present, Dark Harvest can never be gained from Sion under the effect of Glory in Death.
* At the start of Glory in Death, Sion's mana drops to 0, but his mana regeneration will remain in effect.

---

**Zombie info**

Zombie states trigger upon taking lethal damage.

* Raw damage effects will not prevent zombie states from triggering.
* All resurrection effects will take precedence over effects that reanimate as a zombie.
* A champion that enters a zombie state will start their death timer upon triggering the effect.
* Most buffs and debuffs will be lost upon transitioning into a zombie state.
* Those that persist through death, such as Brand's Blaze, will remain.
* Undisplayed marker buffs, such as those imposed by Veigar's Event Horizon and Viktor's Gravity Field to prevent being affected multiple times by the same effect, will be lost.
* (bug) This does not apply when transitioning from one zombie state to another zombie state.
* (bug) Units within a zombie state cannot:
	+ Use Recall or Corrupting Potion / Refillable Potion.
	+ Activate resurrection effects.
	+ Take Dark Passage, Catapult, or gates.
	+ Pick up the Eye of the Herald.
	+ Be targeted by the following:
		- Bailout, Chronoshift, Umbral Trespass.
	+ Be affected by the following:
		- Curse of the Black Mist, Fear Beyond Death's chain missile, Test of Spirit's initial missile, Lamb's Respite, Realm of Death, Fountain health restore.
* Targeting input: Auto
* Notes: Death Surge grants the bonus movement speed after a brief delay. The buff is intended to grant 75% decaying movement speed, but instead grants 67% movement speed decaying with -8% per stat update. Precisely this leaves him at 0% - 0% (based on time passed) bonus movement speed. Death Surge has a shared cooldown across each ability key, regardless of which key is used to activate it. Thus, activating Death Surge with any ability key will put the others on cooldown. Death Surge's cooldown resets upon death. Death Surge's cooldown is affected by ability haste and thus the ability is technically able to be used up to twice during a single instance of Glory in Death, but this isn't practical. Death Surge is not affected by Ultimate Hunter, even if cast from the ultimate ability slot. Despite showing the cooldown being reduced, Death Surge in the ultimate ability slot will be not reduced by Axiom Arc's Flux on takedown. (bug) Death Surge's cooldown is not reduced by Navori Quickblades' Deft Strike.Edit

New voiceover
New lore
Glory in Death: New I
Sion turns berserk once he loses all his health, gaining a full life bar along with significant attack damage, attack speed, and lifesteal as he bleeds out. His abilities are all replaced by Death Surge, which gives him a huge but brief movement speed boost. Sion dies once his health drains out.
Decimating Smash: New Q
Sion plants his feet, rooting himself as he winds up and swings his axe in a broad area before him. Decimating Smash deals increasing damage the longer it's charged, and once it's at least half-charged, knocks up all caught enemies when unleashed.
Soul Furnace: New W
Passive: Sion earns bonus max health every time he kills a unit.
Active: Sion creates a bloody shield around him. If the shield stays intact for its duration, it explodes, dealing magic damage to all nearby enemies. Sion can also detonate the shield early by reactivating the ability.
Roar of the Slayer: New E
Sion bellows in a target direction, damaging, slowing, and shredding the armor of the first enemy struck. If Roar of the Slayer hits an enemy minion or jungle monster, Sion's scream also knocks them back a significant distance. The thrown minion or monster then damages and slows all other enemy units hit.
Unstoppable Onslaught: New R
Sion starts charging in a target direction, building up speed as he moves and trampling enemy minions along his path. He can cancel his charge early, at which point he slams the ground, dealing area of effect damage to all nearby enemies. Otherwise, Sion charges an extremely long distance, only stopping once he hits an enemy champion, wall, or reaches the end of his charge. If Sion charges into an enemy champion, he knocks them up and deals area of effect damage; if he hits a wall, Sion stuns himself briefly and deals area of effect damage around him.
Trivia:
Sion, the Undead Champion
When permanent health stacking was added to Enrage in the May 9, 2009 Patch, Sion became the first champion to have an ability that could infinitely stack an effect.
Sion was one of the first six champions designed, together with Annie, Lee Sin, Singed, Sivir, and Twisted Fate.
Of these, he was however the first and only one to recieve a full relaunch after his initial release, completely remaking the original appearance and gameplay.
Sion, the Undead Juggernaut
Sion is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect: Aurelion Sol, Bard, Bel'Veth, Cho'Gath, Draven, Kindred, Nasus, Senna, Shyvana, Smolder, Swain, Sylas, Thresh, and Veigar.
In Sion's case, Soul Furnace infinitely stacks his health.
Sion's updated 'Champion Spotlight' was the last to feature the old Summoner's Rift map.
Unstoppable Onslaught was inspired by Juggernaut from X-Men.
[4]
With Unstoppable Onslaught, Sion is one of a few champions who can apply crowd control on themselves (the others being Blitzcrank, Caitlyn, Galio, Graves, Kled, Lissandra, Poppy, Rammus, Rumble, Tahm Kench, Varus, Vi, Xerath, and Ziggs).
Glory in Death is one of three abilities which allow their casters to continue fighting after death (the others being Death Defied and Icathian Surprise).
Sion's passive is the only of these three that lasts a variable time, determined by his health running out.
Sion is also the only targetable 'Zombie-state' of the three, which was previously shared with Omen of Death,
Yorick's original ultimate.
