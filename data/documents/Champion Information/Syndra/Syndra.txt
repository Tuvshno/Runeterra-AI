* Trivia
  * Syndra is the only champion to directly manipulate minions and neutral monsters to deal damage to other champions, moving them around with her abilities.
  * Syndra's spheres appear as red instead of blue when on the opposing team. She is the fourth champion to have team perspective based particles, with the third being Draven, the second being Cassiopeia, and the first being Singed.
  * On her Atlantean and Snow Day skins, they appear purple to enemy instead.
  * Using Syndra's Force of Will to hit an enemy unit with the Red Brambleback will apply the debuff on them. Also, if Syndra throws the Blue Sentinel, she will be refunded 10 mana and the ability's cooldown will be lowered by 1 second.
  * Syndra is the third of the dark-themed Ionian Champions. The first two being Shen and Varus, followed by Zed, Jhin, Xayah, & Kayn.
  * Syndra's imprisonment under the Dream Pool shares some similarities with the Arthurian lore about Lady of the Lake; though Syndra herself is the prisoner, not the jailer.
  * Syndra's dance references the choreography for the song 'Hoot' by Girls' Generation (소녀시대: So Nyeo Shi Dae), a popular Korean girl group.
  * A side-by-side comparison can be seen [here](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Syndra).
  * Syndra was the third champion to have a difficulty rating of 100, the first being Cassiopeia, the second being Orianna, and the fourth being Draven. However, her difficulty rating has since fallen to 80. On release, her difficulty rating was 90.
  * Each of Syndra's abilities gain new graphical details when leveled to max rank.
  * Syndra is the second champion speculated to be omnipotent, or nearly so. The first one was Xerath.
  * As seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlLgFt_Ax5s), Syndra appears to be able to use the balls from another Syndra.
  * The fact that Syndra's Unleashed Power can use up to seven balls is possibly a reference to the Dragon Ball franchise as there are seven Dragon Balls.
  * Syndra is the second of three dark themed champions to have a light themed skin, with Varus being the first and Aatrox being the third.
  * Syndra apparently derives from Proto-Germanic *sundr az, ('of/by/for one self'; whence English sunder), with possible influence from unrelated Greek συνδρομή syndrome.
  * Her brother's name, Evard, likewise combines two Germanic elements īhwaz 'yew' & wardaz 'guard'.
