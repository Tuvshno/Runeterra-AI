### Abilities

#### Warpath

**Innate:** Hecarim gains bonus attack damage equal to 12% - 24% (based on level) of his bonus movement speed.

##### Details

- Warpath's bonus attack damage adjusts itself to any temporary movement speed buffs and debuffs Hecarim is affected by.
- Since this only affects bonus values, Hecarim will not dip below his regular attack damage if he is slowed below his base movement speed.
- The amount of movement speed scaling to bonus attack damage is refreshed every 0.25 seconds.

#### Rampage

**COST:** 28 / 26 / 24 / 22 / 20 Mana

**COOLDOWN:** 4 seconds

**CAST TIME:** none

**EFFECT RADIUS:** 375

**Active:** Hecarim cleaves his glaive around himself, dealing physical damage to nearby enemies, reduced to 60% against minions.

| Statistic | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Physical Damage | 60 / 85 / 110 / 135 / 160 (+ 90% bonus AD) |
| Minion Damage | 36 / 51 / 66 / 81 / 96 (+ 54% bonus AD) |

**If this damages an enemy, Hecarim gains a stack of Rampage for 8 seconds.** Stacks refresh on subsequent damage and stack up to 3 times. Each stack increases Rampage's damage by 3% (+ 4% per 100 bonus AD) and reduces its base cooldown by 0.75 seconds, up to a 9% (+ 12% per 100 bonus AD) damage increase and a 2.25-second reduction of the base cooldown at maximum stacks. Stacks expire by one every 1 second when the duration ends.

##### Map-Specific Differences

- Ultra Rapid Fire: stacking cooldown reduction effect removed.
- Arena: base damage changed to 80 / 105 / 130 / 155 / 180.

#### Spirit of Dread

**COST:** 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 Mana

**COOLDOWN:** 16 / 15.5 / 15 / 14.5 / 14 seconds

**CAST TIME:** none

**EFFECT RADIUS:** 525

**Active:** Hecarim surrounds himself with the Spirit of Dread for 5 seconds, dealing magic damage every second to nearby enemies and gaining bonus armor and magic resistance. He is also healed for 20% of the post-mitigation damage dealt to enemies within the area, halved to 10% for damage dealt by allies. The healing is capped against minions and monsters.

| Statistic | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Magic Damage Per Tick | 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 (+ 20% AP) |
| Total Magic Damage | 100 / 150 / 200 / 250 / 300 (+ 100% AP) |
| Bonus Resistances | 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 |
| Capped Healing | 120 / 150 / 180 / 210 / 240 |

##### Map-Specific Differences

- Ultra Rapid Fire: base healing changed to 35% of damage dealt. Healing bonus AD ratio changed to 3% per 100 bonus AD.
- Arena: base healing changed to 35% of damage dealt.

#### Devastating Charge

**COST:** 60 Mana

**COOLDOWN:** 18 seconds

**CAST TIME:** none

**Active:** Hecarim becomes ghosted and gains 25% - 65% (based on time active) bonus total movement speed for 4 seconds. During this time, he empowers his next basic attack to gain 50 - 250 (based on distance traveled) bonus range and cause him to dash in the target's direction, revealing them for 1 second. If the target remains nearby during the dash, the ghosting and bonus movement speed ends prematurely and Hecarim knocks them back 150 - 350 (based on distance traveled) units, stuns them for 0.25 seconds, and deals them modified physical damage, increased by 0% - 100% (based on distance traveled).

| Statistic | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Minimum Physical Damage | 30 / 45 / 60 / 75 / 90 (+ 50% bonus AD) |
| Maximum Physical Damage | 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 (+ 100% bonus AD) |
| Devastating Charge can critically strike for (75% + 50%) bonus physical damage |
| Devastating Charge resets Hecarim's basic attack timer |
| Hecarim can cast any of his abilities while dashing |
| Devastating Charge's duration is paused during Onslaught of Shadows |
| If the target does not remain nearby during the dash, Devastating Charge's effect will not be consumed |
| The bonus movement speed stacks multiplicatively with other sources of movement speed boosts |
| The bonus attack range stacks additively with Rapid Firecannon |
| Devastating Charge's damage will still apply life steal and will affect structures |
| "Distance traveled" can be simple movement as well as dashing and blinking |
| Devastating Charge's damage will not bypass block or dodge but the knock back will still be applied |
| Devastating Charge will still deal damage while blinded |
| While grounded or rooted, Hecarim loses the bonus attack range from Devastating Charge |
| Hecarim will not use the empowered attack while rooted |
| The dash does not follow targets. The target's position at the time of the enhanced attack is the direction Hecarim will leap to |
| Displacement immunity will not resist the application of the stun |

##### Map-Specific Differences

- Ultra Rapid Fire: cooldown begins after the empowered attack is used or times out.
- Arena: minimum base damage changed to 50 / 65 / 80 / 95 / 110. Maximum base damage changed to 100 / 130 / 160 / 190 / 220. Minimum bonus AD ratio changed to 60% bonus AD. Maximum bonus AD ratio changed to 120% bonus AD.

#### Onslaught of Shadows

**COST:** 100 Mana

**COOLDOWN:** 140 / 120 / 100 / 80 / 60 seconds

**CAST TIME:** none

**TARGET RANGE:** 1000 / 300 range

**EFFECT RADIUS:** 315 width

**SPEED:** 1100

**Active:** Hecarim dashes with displacement immunity to the target location and summons 5 spectral riders in an arrow formation that charge alongside him in the target direction, dealing magic damage to all enemies in their path and revealing them for 2.5 seconds. Upon arrival, he fears nearby enemies for 0.75 - 1.5 (based on distance traveled) seconds and slows them, ramping to 99% over the duration. The wave of spectral riders travels independently of Hecarim and will always charge at the same distance. The slow's strength cannot be reduced and is increased based on how far away the affected units are from Hecarim. Onslaught of Shadows will cast at max range if cast beyond that.

##### Map-Specific Differences

- Ultra Rapid Fire: removed.
