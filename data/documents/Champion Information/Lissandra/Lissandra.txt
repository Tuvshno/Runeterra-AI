**EFFECT RADIUS:**
1350 / 450

**Innate:**
Whenever a nearby enemy champion dies,
Lissandra
spawns a
Frozen Thrall
from their corpse.

**Frozen Thralls**
are ice spirits that have
33.48
(based on seconds)
movement speed
and
slow
nearby enemies by 25%. They will chase nearby
visible
enemies for 4 seconds, prioritizing
champions
, after which they shatter to deal
120 – 520 (based on level) (+ 50% AP)
magic damage
to nearby enemies.

Thralls
are units that are considered champions (they are
clones
) and they take the form of the champion they arise from. Additionally, near the end of their life span, they will cue that champion's
basic attack
animation. They cannot be teleported by an allied
Realm Warp
. Thralls are
untargetable
and
invulnerable
. Thralls are revealed to enemies through the fog of war. Thralls will continue to chase their target even if they enter a
brush
. Iceborn Subjugation
will not summon a
Thrall
against enemy champions that enter a
zombie state
, and will instead summon one after they've left the state.

This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Ice Shard picks a location 950 units away in the direction of the cast for the shattered missile to end up at. The initial Ice Shard missile has a range of 700 units which it arrives at after 0.33 seconds. If it hasn't collided with an enemy in this path when it does, it checks for enemies in a 100 radius around the point 25 units in front of it. Colliding or hitting an enemy in either fashion creates a new "shattered" missile with the same speed but greater width that continues to travel along the same line to the designated point 950 units from the cast's original position, originating at the location at which the initial missile collided at. Spell shield will block the damage and the slow but will not stop the projectile from shattering.

Lissandra
to surpass through every single wall in all maps, so long as the claw is at least halfway through them. Glacial Path

Enemies can only be damaged by the field of ice once every 4 seconds. Under normal circumstances, this means once per cast of
Frozen Tomb
. Enemies who come in contact with
Frozen Tomb's
slow field will be damaged and a small visual and sound effect will play. Spell shield will block the single-targeted portion and the radiating ice damage, but will not stop it from spreading. If the target becomes
untargetable
, dies, or is too far away during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost. This only applies to the enemy cast.

As the reclusive leader of the Frostguard, many believe Lissandra is a living saint whose followers bring healing and wisdom to the tribes of the Freljord. The truth is perhaps more sinister, as she uses her elemental magic to twist the power of True Ice into something dark and terrible, entombing or impaling any who would reveal her deepest secrets. Indeed, the legacy of her past may yet be the beginning of the end for Runeterra.

Once a powerful sorceress who sought absolute control over her followers, Lissandra transformed into something altogether different when she finally found the hallowed Bloodstone. The magic she drew from it drove her to slay those who once tended to her every whim. To this day she wanders in search of more mortals to sacrifice to her newfound source of power.

Ruler of a once mighty city, Lissandra was seduced by the promises of a monstrous shadow, whispering of esoteric power and eternal life. For this, she betrayed her people and gave them to darkness, so that in the shadow's womb she would be reborn an ageless monster.

Brutal alien leader of the Harsh Vibes, Lissandra subjugates planets rich in The Groove for her own nefarious purposes—banning disco and steeping the entire galaxy in Muzak. She and her army of roller-skating derby goons will stop at nothing to eliminate disco forever. But for her latest scheme to work, she's going to need an invite to the disco to end all discos: The Jam.

Once a cosmic entity charged with identifying future threats to the cosmos, her hunger for ever greater knowledge drew her into conflict with the Dark Star, which consumed her. Transformed into a mad doomsayer who sees a “true” universe in the ashes of this one, she has become the very end she once feared.

Long ago, the sorceress Lissandra stole the Snake Relic from the ancient Protectors in a bid to gain immortality. Cast down and sealed away for her crimes, Lissandra spent centuries of solitude scheming a way to take all twelve Zodiac Relics for herself, waiting for the perfect time to strike... And now Ezreal has given her the chance.

Trivia
[ ]
Lissandra first appeared in the
Journal of Justice
,
Issue 2
, several years before her announcement as a champion. Like now, she was portrayed as the leader of one of the three tribes of the Freljord, but her portrayal was originally vastly different, as a mortal princess allied with
Ashe
's tribe.
This was later revealed to be her alter ego, and most people are not aware of her being the Ice Witch herself.
If Ashe, Lissandra, and/or
Sejuani
are played on opposing teams,
Battle for Freljord
will trigger. This in-game quest consists in one killing the other to earn the title of 'Queen of Freljord' (complete with a floating ice crown floating above their heads) referencing the civil war taking place there, between the three tribes each lead.
Lissandra is the only champion to possess a single-targeted ability (
Frozen Tomb
) that can be used on herself but not on allies.
Lissandra,
Elise
, and
Lucian
are the only champions to feature a monologue on their login screens.
Lissandra
may be the feminine form of Greek name Λύσανδρος (Lysander or 'liberator').
Her champion theme is the same as the pick music of
ARAM
and is titled 'Freljord'.
