**Abilities**

* **Runic Blade**
  + Innate: Riven's ability casts generate a stack of Charge for 6 seconds, refreshing on subsequent casts and stacking up to 3 times. Riven's basic attacks are empowered to consume a stack, dealing bonus physical damage equal to 30% − 60% (based on level) AD against enemies and reduced to 50% − 15% (based on level) AD against structures. The bonus damage is affected by critical strike modifiers and applies life steal at 100% effectiveness.
  + Runic Blade's duration also refreshes when Riven consumes a stack. The empowered attack will not trigger against wards.

* **Broken Wings**
  + COOLDOWN: 13 seconds
  + CAST TIME: none
  + EFFECT RADIUS: 150 / 250 / 200 / 300
  + Active: Riven can activate Broken Wings three times before the ability goes on cooldown, with a 0.3125-second static cooldown between casts. Riven slashes with her sword for each of the three casts, dealing physical damage to enemies struck within an area, resetting her basic attack timer, and ordering her to basic attack the target of Broken Wings if there are any.
  + Physical Damage: 15 / 35 / 55 / 75 / 95 (+ 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70% AD)
  + Total Physical Damage: 45 / 105 / 165 / 225 / 285 (+ 150 / 165 / 180 / 195 / 210% AD)
  + First Cast: Riven dashes up to 225 units towards the target enemy or in the direction she is currently facing, striking enemies in the target area 100 units away. This cast cannot cross terrain.
  + Second Cast: Riven mimics the first cast's effects.
  + Third Cast: Riven mimics the first cast's effects in a larger area while also knocking back enemies hit 75 units over 0.5 seconds. This cast can cross terrain.
  + Damage type: Type: Sub-type: Area damage: Physical
  + Counters: Parries, Blocked, Runic Blade's duration also refreshes when Riven consumes a stack.
  + The empowered attack will not trigger against wards.
  + Each cast counts as a single ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive.
  + The basic attack reset is not considered one for Hail of Blades.
  + Moving after using Broken Wings allows Riven to do other actions faster.
  + The Third Cast prevents Riven from using basic attacks and abilities for longer than the other 2 casts.
  + The Third Cast may have an extended dash range when crossing terrain.

* **Ki Burst**
  + COOLDOWN: 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 / 7 seconds
  + CAST TIME: 0.25 seconds
  + EFFECT RADIUS: 300 / 360
  + Active: Riven emits a flash of runic energy before the cast time, dealing physical damage to nearby enemies and stunning them for 0.75 seconds.
  + Physical Damage: 65 / 95 / 125 / 155 / 185 (+ 100% bonus AD)
  + Riven is briefly unable to basic attack after the cast time.
  + Broken Wings may be cast while basic attacking briefly after casting Ki Burst (bug).

* **Valor**
  + COOLDOWN: 10 / 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 seconds
  + CAST TIME: none
  + RANGE: 250
  + Active: Riven dashes to the target location, though not through terrain, while granting herself a shield for 1.5 seconds.
  + Shield Strength: 80 / 105 / 130 / 155 / 180 (+ 110% bonus AD)
  + Riven can cast any of her abilities during the dash. Valor will cast at max range if cast beyond that.
  + Broken Wings may be cast during Ki Burst or Blade of the Exile cast times if they're used at the end or briefly after the dash (bug).

* **Blade of the Exile**
  + COOLDOWN: 120 / 90 / 60 seconds
  + CAST TIME: 0.25 seconds
  + Active: Riven empowers her blade for 15 seconds, gaining 25% AD bonus attack damage, 75 bonus attack range, and increased range on Broken Wings and Ki Burst. After 0.5 seconds, she can cast Wind Slash within the duration.

* **Wind Slash**
  + CAST TIME: 0.25 seconds
  + TARGET RANGE: 1100
  + WIDTH: 200
  + ANGLE: 18°
  + SPEED: 1600
  + Active: Riven unleashes a wave of energy in a cone in the target direction that deals physical damage to enemies hit, increased by 0% − 200% (based on target's missing health).
  + Minimum Physical Damage: 100 / 150 / 200 (+ 60% bonus AD)
  + Maximum Physical Damage: 300 / 450 / 600 (+ 180% bonus AD)
  + Notes: All bonuses are gained after 0.5 seconds of the ability starting its cast. The bonus attack damage amount is factored upon cast, and does not change. If Riven has a basic attack buffered before the end of Blade of the Exile's cast time, the buffered basic attack will start 0.33 seconds after the end of the cast time. The delay will not apply to basic attack commands input after Blade of the Exile's cast time.
  + Wind Slash counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive.
  + This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
  + Wind Slash's wave is made up of three individual missiles spread in a cone.
  + Each enemy can be damaged by only one missile.
  + If Wind Slash hits an enemy while Riven is not visible, it will briefly grant sight of the area around her to enemies.
  + If Riven has a basic attack buffered before the end of Wind Slash's cast time, the buffered basic attack will start 0.528 seconds after the end of the cast time. The delay is not applied if a basic attack command is input after the cast time.
