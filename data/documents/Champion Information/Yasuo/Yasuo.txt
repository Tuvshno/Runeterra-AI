**Edit**

* Way of the Wanderer: Innate - Intent, Innate - Resolve
* Steel Tempest

**Steel Tempest**

* Cast Time: 0.35 - 0.175 (based on bonus attack speed), Static Cooldown: 4 - 1.33 (based on bonus attack speed)
* Range: 450 / 1150, Effect Radius: 215, Width: 80 / 180, Speed: 1200
* Active: Yasuo thrusts his sword in a line in the target direction that deals physical damage to enemies hit and applies on-hit and on-attack effects at 100% effectiveness to the first enemy hit. Steel Tempest's damage can critically strike for (47% + 42%) AD bonus physical damage. Physical Damage: 20 / 45 / 70 / 95 / 120 (+ 105% AD), If this hits at least one enemy, Yasuo generates a stack of Gathering Storm for 6 seconds, stacking up to 2 times and refreshing on subsequent hits. At 2 stacks, the next Steel Tempest consumes them all to become empowered with a new effect.
* Gathering Storm Bonus: Yasuo unleashes a whirlwind in the target direction that deals the same damage to enemies hit and knocks them up for 0.75 seconds, or 0.9 seconds in combination with Sweeping Blade.
* Steel Tempest's thrust is interrupted if Yasuo is affected by disarming crowd control during the cast time, but its cooldown is reset to 0.1 seconds. If Steel Tempest is cast during Sweeping Blade, it will instead affect enemies around Yasuo at the end of the dash, or doing so immediately at his landing location after blinking while ending the dash prematurely.

**Tips & Tricks**

* Map-Specific Differences: Arena differences (Base shield changed to 130% value)

**Info**

* Targeting input: Passive, Direction, Damage type, Type, Sub-type, Minion Aggro
* Physical: See Notes, Not Drawn, Counters: Spell shield, Grounded, See Notes, Disabled, Interrupted
* Casting: Sweeping Blade when Steel Tempest's remaining cooldown is less than 0.5 seconds resets its remaining cooldown to allow casting it in combination, but adds the refunded time to the cooldown of that cast. If Yasuo becomes unable to cast abilities during the dash after buffering, Steel Tempest will not cast, but will still go on cooldown. (bug)
* The one Gathering Storm stack is named Steel Wind Rising.
* The whirlwind from consuming stacks of Gathering Storm can strike targets whose center is behind Yasuo, unlike most missiles.
* The whirlwind is not released when cast during Sweeping Blade, but instead knocks up all enemies hit around Yasuo at the end of the dash.
* Steel Tempest applies basic damage to the first (closest) enemy hit and area damage to secondary enemies.
* Steel Tempest will apply on-hit effects to the first target hit, but will not do so to the secondary ones.
* Steel Tempest will not apply spell effects to the first target hit, but will do so to the secondary ones.
* Spell vamp will only grant healing from the damage dealt to secondary targets, and healing is reduced to 33% effectiveness, accordingly.
* Life steal will heal based on the damage dealt to the first target hit.
* The whirlwind is a missile and can therefore be intercepted.
* Steel Tempest will only draw minion aggro if the first target is a champion.
* This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
* Each parry has different interactions with this ability, whether it's the first target or the secondary one. In either case, Yasuo still gains a stack of Gathering Storm and his whirlwind knock-up cannot be negated by parries: Dodge: both first target and secondary target do not take damage. Block: first target does not take damage, secondary target does take damage. Blind: both first target and secondary target do take damage.
* Steel Tempest rolls its critical strikes individually against each enemy hit.
* Casting Last Breath during Steel Tempest will buffer it to cast after the cast time has completed.
* However, if Last Breath is used on a target affected by an airborne source that is not Yasuo, it is cast immediately due to Steel Tempest's cast time ending prematurely.
* Steel Tempest will still cast in this case.
* If Steel Tempest is buffered during Sweeping Blade and Yasuo uses Recall, Teleport, or Hextech Rocketbelt, Steel Tempest will go on cooldown without casting. In Protobelt's case, Yasuo will also need to cast a movement command after it, else Steel Tempest will still trigger.
* Spell shield does not prevent a stack of Gathering Storm from being gained.
* While at two stacks, a range indicator will be shown for the effective range of the whirlwind.
* Casting Last Breath while buffering Steel Tempest during Sweeping Blade will also trigger the damage after the blink, thus avoiding the Gathering Storm stack reset.

**Map-Specific Differences**

* Odyssey differences: On-target cooldown changed to 50% value, Base damage changed to 75 / 90 / 105 / 120 / 135.

**Last Breath**

* COOLDOWN: 70 / 50 / 30, CAST TIME: none, TARGET RANGE: 1400, EFFECT RADIUS: 400
* Active: Yasuo blinks to the other side of a visible airborne enemy champion nearest to the cursor, instantly generating maximum Flow while resetting Gathering Storm stacks. Upon arrival, he knocks up all nearby airborne enemy champions for 1 second, reveals them, and slashes them with his sword over the duration, dealing physical damage thereafter. Surrounding enemy champions that become airborne during this time will also be affected by Last Breath through the remaining duration. Physical Damage: 200 / 350 / 500 (+ 150% AD). For the next 15 seconds, Yasuo's critical strikes gain 50% bonus -armor penetration. A nearby airborne enemy champion is required to cast this ability. If Yasuo would blink inside the attack range of an enemy turret (excluding the Nexus Obelisk), Last Breath will instead attempt to position him outside of it.

**Tips & Tricks**

* Map-Specific Differences: Arena differences (Base shield changed to 130% value, Stealth Wall: removed passive Flow per Sweeping Blade cast)

**Trivia**

* Yasuo is one of seven pairs of sibling champions (the others being Jinx - Vi, Cassiopeia - Katarina, Kayle - Morgana, Garen - Lux, Nasus - Renekton, and Darius - Draven). Though not a pair, Anivia, Ornn, and Volibear are also siblings.
* The flute Yasuo plays in his dance emote is most likely a Shakuhachi (harmonica for High Noon; wind controller for PROJECT).
* His Classic 'dance' references a performance of this instrument.
* Yasuo is the first champion to have an emote that will orient itself the same (dancing emote, facing the bottom-right of the screen), no matter what direction Yasuo was facing. Akali is the second.
* The melody of his Classic dance complements Yone's when the two use the dance emote simultaneously. A side-by-side comparison can be seen here.
* Yasuo's design is largely based on the Japanese rōnin (lit. a wanderer), a samurai whose masters had died or stripped of titles & lands. Many rōnin became mercenaries, bodyguards, or even criminals.
* The length of Yasuo's sword is about that of a tachi or even an ōdachi. However, he wears it cutting edge up like the shorter katana.
* Yasuo [jasɯ̟ᵝo] is a Japanese masculine given name, rendered as 康夫 (roughly "peaceful man") in the Japanese localization.
* From Old Japanese *yasu- (cheap, easy > peaceful) and masculine morpheme *wo.
* Way of the Wanderer's modified critical strike chance references Samurai gameplay portrayals in video games.
* For April Fools' Day 2017, a video showcasing a joke rework for Yasuo was posted by the official Riot Games Twitter account.
* Way of the Wanderer was shown to have Resolve's shield also provide crowd control immunity, similar to Morgana's Black Shield.
* Steel Tempest's third cast was shown to split into three additional whirlwinds in a cone after hitting a champion, similar to Graves' Collateral Damage.
* Wind Wall was shown to form a pentagon of walls, similar to Thresh's The Box.
* Notably, this 'protection from projectiles from all angles' mechanic was later implemented by Samira's Blade Whirl.
* Sweeping Blade was shown to be able to target wards and champion summoned units (e.g. Demacian Standard).
* Last Breath was shown to be able to be recast for a seemingly infinite amount of times while the affected champion is still airborne.
