**Abilities**

* [Voracity]
  + Effect radius: 340
  + Innate: Scoring a champion takedown within 3 seconds of damaging them reduces the current cooldowns of Katarina's abilities by 15 seconds.
  + Innate - Sinister Steel: Whenever Katarina retrieves a Dagger, she slashes around to deal 68 - 240 (based on level) (+ 60% bonus AD) (+ 70 / 80 / 90 / 100% based on level) AP magic damage to nearby enemies and against champions, and reduces Shunpo's current cooldown by 78 / 84 / 90 / 96% (based on level) of its total cooldown. Daggers grant sight of their radius and will disappear after being on the ground for 4 seconds.
  + Map-Specific Differences: Arena differences
* [Bouncing Blade]
  + Cooldown: 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 / 7
  + Cast time: 0.25 seconds
  + Target range: 625
  + Effect radius: 450
  + Active: Katarina throws a Dagger at the target enemy that deals magic damage and can bounce to up to two additional nearby enemies. Magic Damage: 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 / 200 (+ 35% AP). The Dagger then lands onto the ground after 1 second, about 350 units opposite from where it struck the first target. The target does not have to be visible for the Dagger to bounce to them.
  + Map-Specific Differences: Map-Specific Differences - Arena differences
* [Preparation]
  + Cooldown: 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 / 11
  + Cast time: None
  + Active: Katarina tosses a Dagger into the air above her current location and gains bonus movement speed that decays until it lands after 1.25 seconds, becoming ghosted for the same duration. Bonus Movement speed: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90%.
* [Shunpo]
  + Cooldown: 14 / 12.5 / 11 / 9.5 / 8
  + Cast time: None
  + Target range: 725 / 775
  + Active: Katarina blinks to the target location around the target unit or Dagger, dealing magic damage to the nearest enemy in range and applying on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness. Magic Damage: 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80 (+ 40% AD) (+ 25% AP). Shunpo resets Katarina's basic attack timer. Upon blinking, Katarina enters a 0.15-second cast time.
  + Map-Specific Differences: Map-Specific Differences - Targeting input, Unit Target out-of-range override, Walk in range of the target, Damage type, Type, Sub-type, Minion Aggro, Spell damage, Magic, Drawn, Counters, Spell shield, Parries, Grounded, Blocked, See Notes, Disabled, Shunpo can be used on any unit except structures and wards, Shunpo can be cast on Daggers that haven't landed yet, Shunpo prioritizes damaging enemy champions within range at the targetted location, If Katarina Shunpos on an ally, any attack command she is given during its cast time will be negated, and every movement command will be delayed by 1 second (starting at the start of the cast time), Shunpo should be an instant ability but it has extra logic to consider which makes it have a short cast time, Flash can be used during cast time but it will not cancel the blink.
* [Death Lotus]
  + Cooldown: 90 / 60 / 45
  + Cast time: None
  + Effect radius: 550
  + Speed: 2400
  + Active: Katarina channels for up to 2.5 seconds, rapidly throwing a dagger every 0.166 seconds to up to 3 of the closest nearby enemy champions, revealing herself in the process. Each dagger deals physical damage and magic damage, applies on-attack and on-hit (without applying life steal) effects, and inflicts Grievous Wounds on the target for 3 seconds. Physical Damage Per Dagger: 16% (+ 50% per 100% bonus attack speed) bonus AD. Maximum Physical Damage: 240% (+ 750% per 100% bonus attack speed) bonus AD. On-Attack/On-Hit Effectiveness: 30 / 35 / 40%. An enemy champion within 500 units is required to cast this ability. The target does not have to be visible to be hit by this ability.
