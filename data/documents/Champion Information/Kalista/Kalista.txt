**Basic Attack**

* Attack range: 525
* Basic attack: Kalista's basic attack windup is uncancellable except by casting Rend, although she can input a new attack command to change her target during the windup. Additionally, Kalista's attack windup is only reduced by 0.75% per 1% bonus attack speed.

* Kalista shares having an unusual basic attack windup modifier with a few other champions. See List of champions/Basic attacks for a list. Kalista also has the longest relative basic attack windup time of all champions, however this is offset by her high base attack speed and attack speed scaling.

**Martial Poise**

* Target range: 250 / 265 / 280 (based on Boots Tier)
* SPEED: 1025 / 1100 / 1160 (based on Boots Tier)
* Innate: Whenever Kalista inputs a movement command during her basic attack windup or the cast time of Pierce, she will dash in the target direction. Kalista's dash from Martial Poise will be knocked down by any immobilizing or polymorphing crowd control, excluding sleep (bug).
* The range and speed of Martial Poise are modified by the tier of Kalista's Boots. The base range when dashing from a basic attack is 250 / 265 / 280 (based on Boots Tier) units. This base distance is reduced when dashing toward the direction of her attack, to a minimum of 150 / 165 / 180 (based on Boots Tier) units. The base range when dashing from Pierce's cast is increased by 50 units. The if dashing away from the point of cast, the dash range is reduced, to a minimum of 165 / 180 / 195 (based on Boots Tier) units.
* Innate - Oathsworn Bond: Kalista begins the game with an exclusive Black Spear.

**Pierce**

* Cost: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 Mana
* Cooldown: 8
* Cast time: 0.25
* Target range: 1200
* Width: 80
* SPEED: 2400
* Active: Kalista launches a spear in the target direction that deals physical damage to the first enemy hit. Physical Damage: 20 / 85 / 150 / 215 / 280 (+ 105% AD). If Pierce kills the target, the spear continues onward to transfer all of the target's Rend stacks to the next enemy it hits. This can repeat indefinitely until the spear reaches its maximum range.
* Map-Specific Differences
* Arena differences: edit
  + AD ratio changed to 135% AD.

**Sentinel**

* Passive - Soul-Marked: While Kalista and her Oathsworn are tethered, their basic attacks and Pierce apply a Soul-Mark to their targets. If both Soul-Marks are applied to the same target within 4 seconds, they take bonus magic damage, capped against non-champions, and cannot be Soul-Marked again for a few seconds. Soul-Mark deals a minimum of 75 damage to minions, executes them if they're below 125 health, and is capped against non-champions.
* Active: Kalista summons a Sentinel that patrols back and forth on a path along the target location, granting sight of its surroundings as it travels. Kalista periodically stocks a Sentinel charge, up to a maximum of 2. See Pets for more details about Sentinels.
* The Soul-Marks' bonus damage is credited to Kalista and will benefit from both her magic penetration and spell effects. If her Oathsworn ally scores a kill using Soul-Marked's bonus damage, they will get a message stating 'Kill Secured' in place of the usual gold pop-up (the gold itself is credited to Kalista). The Sentinel's sight reveal on enemy champions is accredited for assists and potentially kills (if they die shortly after being spotted). It does not reveal stealthed targets.
* Sentinel will cast from wherever Kalista is at the end of the cast time.
* PENDING FOR TEST: : Soul Mark's interaction with parrying effects (dodge, block, blind).
* PENDING FOR TEST: If Pierce kills the target by Soul-Mark's additional damage, it will/will not continue.

**Rend**

* Cost: 30 Mana
* Cooldown: 10 / 9.5 / 9 / 8.5 / 8
* Cast time: 0.25
* Effect radius: 1100
* Passive: Kalista's basic attacks on-hit and Pierce apply a stack of Rend to enemies for 4 seconds, refreshing on subsequent hits and stacking up to 254 times.
* Active: Kalista rips all lodged spears from nearby enemies, consuming all of their stacks to deal them physical damage and slow them for 2 seconds. Each additional spear on the target deals reduced damage. Physical Damage: 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 (+ 70% AD) (+ 20% AP). Damage per Additional Stack: 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 (+ 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45% AD) (+ 20% AP). Slow: 10 / 18 / 26 / 34 / 42% (+ 5% per 100 AP).
* If Rend kills at least one target, the cooldown is reset and Kalista restores mana. Mana Restored: 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30.
* A nearby enemy with a Rend stack is required to cast this ability. Rend can be used during the dash of Martial Poise and the cast time of Pierce. In-flight spears and Pierce if in cast will be empowered to apply Rend's effects to their targets. These empowered spears can also trigger Rend's refund.

**Fate's Call**

* Cost: 100 mana
* Cooldown: 150 / 120 / 90
* Cast time: none
* Target range: 1200
* Tether radius: 1100
* Active: Kalista invokes her tether to retrieve and hold her Oathsworn for 4 seconds. Kalista cleanses the Oathsworn from all crowd control and renders them invulnerable and untargetable for the duration, and pulls them to her over 1 second. While held, the Oathsworn is vanished and may select to end Fate's Call's invocation and dash with displacement immunity, reappearing at the target location, and doing so at maximum range from Kalista's facing direction when the duration expires. The Oathsworn stops upon colliding with an enemy champion, knocking up all nearby enemies for a duration and finally landing to their base attack range from the target collided with. Knockup Duration: 1 / 1.5 / 2 / 1.75 / 2.
* The Oathsworn must be nearby to cast this ability, and is also silenced and unable to perform movement or attack commands while Fate's Call is in effect.

**Original**

A specter of wrath and retribution, Kalista is the undying spirit of vengeance, an armored nightmare summoned from the Shadow Isles to hunt deceivers and traitors. The betrayed may cry out in blood to be avenged, but Kalista only answers those willing to pay with their very souls. Those who become the focus of Kalista’s wrath should make their final peace, for any pact sealed with this grim hunter can only end with the cold, piercing fire of her soul-spears.

A demon of vengeance summoned on the night of the Blood Moon, Kalista's singular obsession with 'betrayers' knows no limits—any deception, no matter how trivial, will be met with death. Her victims are left hanging from the walls of their homes, a warning to those who remain.

The Magelords… furious, brutal, and glorious in their conquest—a sect of warriors long lost to the sands of time. Until now. Resurrected by the current Marauder leaders, Kalista's desire for vengeance has only festered over the millenia. Now she returns, more powerful than ever, to eradicate the Wardens and everything they've built.

As captain of Her Majesty's royal guard, Kalista is dedicated to keeping her queen safe above all else. Though some grumble that Kalista was only elevated to her station because she is Karma's dearest friend, she has proven time and time again that her title is well earned. Anyone who thinks otherwise is welcome to duel her and learn firsthand.

Trivia
[ ]

* A fully-stacked Rend has the highest AD ratio in the game (5120 / 6068.75 / 7017.5 / 7966.25 / 8915% AD).
* Kalista's dance references Oberyn Martell's spear dance from Game of Thrones. A side-by-side comparison can be seen [here](javascript:void(0)).
* Kalista's 'Champion Spotlight' was the first to feature the updated Summoner's Rift map.
* The Spear of Vengeance resembles the Arrow of Retribution.
* The Black Spear is the third champion-unique item, the first being Prototype Hex Core (Viktor's) and the second being Bonetooth Necklace (Rengar's before it merged with Unseen Predator).
* Her way of referring to herself in the third person, as well as the echo in her voice, resembles Ermac from Mortal Kombat.
* Kalista targeted many betrayers for execution during Harrowing 2014. Cassiopeia for backstabbing, Sivir, Hecarim for his treachery against her in the Blessed Isles, LeBlanc for aiding the barbarian invaders against Mordekaiser and betraying countless others, Lissandra for murdering Avarosa for her spearheading the rebellion against the Frozen Watchers, Twisted Fate for abandoning Graves to be imprisoned in the Locker (Kalista is trying to convince the Outlaw to 'give in to his hate' despite being told by the Card Master he and their crew did try to get him out, reconciling their differences and settling the feud), Xerath for plotting against Azir and laying waste to Ancient Shurima, and Zed for murdering Shen's father Kusho, slaughtering the Kinkou Order, and founding the Order of Shadow over the remains of their monastery.
