			* Scarecrow Effigies are unavailable on ARAM until Fiddlesticks uses its Poro-Snax.
			* The process of pretending to be an Effigy is interrupted if Fiddlesticks moves, takes damage, declares an attack, casts any ability or spell, or starts channeling.
			* Effigies are considered clones and mimic Fiddlesticks's idle animations.
			* Effigies have hidden health bars and are not valid targets for direction, ground, and auto-targeted effects for the first 1.5 seconds of their lifespan.
