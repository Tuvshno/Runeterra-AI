**Abilities**

* [ ]

---

**Basic Attack**

* Attack range: 600
* Speed: N/A
* Basic attack: Senna blasts the target with her relic cannon that uses a non-projectile beam, dealing 100% AD physical damage and applying on-hit and on-attack effects.
* Senna has an attack ratio of 0.4, meaning she only gains +0.4 attack speed per 100% bonus attack speed.
* Senna's base attack windup is reduced to 31.25% - 21.875% (based on level), but is only reduced by 60% of the expected value given attack speed bonuses.
* At level 18, only with the per level bonus attack speed, Senna will have 0.897 attack speed, and will take 0.297 seconds to perform an attack compared to 0.528 seconds at level 1.

---

**Absolution**

* Target immunity: 6 / 5 / 4 (based on level)
* Effect radius: 2000

---

**Innate - Weakened Soul**

* Senna's basic attacks and abilities on enemy champions apply Mist for 4 seconds.
* Senna's next attack collects the Mist and deals 1% - 16% (based on level) of target's current health bonus physical damage.
* The same target cannot be collected more than once every 4 seconds.
* Enemy champions, large minions, and large monsters that die near Senna spawn a Mist Wraith for 8 seconds. Epic monsters spawn 2 Mist Wraiths instead.
* Small minions and lesser monsters that Senna doesn't kill have a 20% chance to spawn Mist Wraiths, reduced to 5.5% chance on those that she kills.
* Senna can basic attack a Mist Wraith to destroy it, gaining 3 and collecting its Mist.

---

**Absolution**

* Each stack of Mist grants Senna 1 bonus attack damage.
* For every 20 stacks, Senna also gains 25 bonus range and 15% critical strike chance.
* Upon exceeding 100% critical strike chance, Senna converts 35% of the excess into life steal.

---

**Innate - Relic Cannon**

* Senna's basic attacks on-hit deal 20% AD bonus physical damage and grant her 10 / 15 / 20% (based on level) of the target's movement speed as bonus movement speed for 0.5 seconds.

**Map-Specific Differences**

* Video: N/A

---

**Passive - Cursed Blades**

* Senna's basic attacks deal 1 damage to Mist Wraiths.

---

**Despite**

* Senna deals 1 damage to Mist Wraiths, but attacking them calculates the attack's damage (including critical strike modifiers) and any on-hit effects for the purposes of life steal and drain effects.
* Relic Cannon is only applied if the attack deals more than 0 damage.
* Hence, Senna can mark and collect from invulnerable enemies.
* Dodge prevents marking and collecting a Mist Wraith via Senna's basic attacks and Piercing Darkness.
* Pending for test: Interaction with block and blinding effects.
* Nunu & Willump spawn a wraith each.
* Enemies will not see newly spawned wraiths while Senna is not visible.
* Minions executed by allies with Spoils of War have a 4.166% chance to spawn wraiths.
* A wraith can be hit by Cosmic Binding and it interacts with it the same way minions or monsters interact with Cosmic Binding but it will not take damage.
* Mist Wraith has a spawn animation, but is targetable immediately.
* Mist Wraith grants a small amount of sight around itself.
* Runaan's Hurricane secondary bolts ignore Mist Wraiths.
* Attacking a Mist Wraith will not consume energized stacks, but you can benefit from the range increase of Rapid Firecannon when collecting wraiths.
* One for All differences: Wraiths are not shared. Weakened Soul debuff application is individually tracked and does not interact among multiple users.
* Arena differences: New effect: Gains 7.5 Mist stacks per round.
