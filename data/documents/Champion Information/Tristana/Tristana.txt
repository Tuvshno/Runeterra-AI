* Trivia
  + Rocket Jump is a reference to rocket jumping in FPS Arena games (like Quake) which allows oneself mobility by using a RPG or any other rocket launcher to accelerates one's jump.
  + Buster Shot is a reference to the attack used by Megaman.
  + Tristana has the fifth longest possible basic attack range in the game with 669 units at level 18, right after Kog'Maw when he uses his Bio-Arcane Barrage, which grants him a 710 attack range, Jinx's Fishbones at rank 5, which grants her a 725 attack range, Twitch when he uses Spray and Pray which grants him a total of 850 attack range, and Seraphine when she has full stacks(20 stacks) of her passive, Stage Presence, granting her a grand total of 1025 attack range(25 per note). This does not count champions that can have theoretically infinite range with stacking.
  + Her dance references a typical soldier's stationary marching while singing a military cadence.
  + A side-by-side comparison can be seen here.
  + Tristana can attack the Baron Nashor over the back wall once she hits Level 15 due to the extra attack range she gains from Draw a Bead.
  + Tristana is the only champion in the game who's passive ability Draw a Bead cannot do anything, under any circumstances, at level 1.
