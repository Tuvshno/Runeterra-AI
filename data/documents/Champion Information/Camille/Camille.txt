**Adaptive Defenses**

**STATIC**
**COOLDOWN:**
18 / 14 / 10 (based on level)

**Innate:**
Periodically, Camille's next basic attack on-hit against an enemy champion grants her a shield equal to 20% of her maximum health, lasting for 2 seconds and absorbing damage from either exclusively physical damage or magic damage, based on which type the target has previously dealt most of against champions as well as on Camille's current armor and magic resistance.

Passive
Adaptive Defenses
goes on cooldown after the shield expires or is destroyed.
The shield-typing is determined based on the total damage the target has dealt to champions that game (as a percentage) versus Camille's current armor and magic resistance.

For example, with little bonus resistances, Camille would likely gain the most obvious shield-typing - i.e., physical shield versus champions primarily dealing physical damage and magic shield versus champions primarily dealing magic damage. However, if she has a sufficient amount of armor against a champion dealing both alternates of physical damage and magic damage, she will receive a magic shield as the physical damage threat is already being mitigated by her armor, and vice versa.

The type of shield that will be granted to Camille when she attacks any one enemy champion is shown as an icon beneath their health bar: orange for physical shield and blue for magic shield.

Adaptive Defenses
takes priority over all other shields except Black Shield.
Adaptive Defenses
Will not grant Camille the shield is the attack is dodged, blocked, or if she is blinded.

**Precision Protocol**

**COST:**
25 Mana
**COOLDOWN:**
9 / 8.25 / 7.5 / 6.75 / 6 Mana
**CAST TIME:**
none

Active: Camille empowers her next basic attack within 4 seconds to have an uncancellable windup, gain 50 bonus range, deal bonus physical damage and grant her bonus movement speed for 1 second.

Bonus Physical Damage: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40% AD
Bonus Movement Speed: 30 / 32.5 / 35 / 37.5 / 40%

After 0.25 seconds, Precision Protocol can then be recast within the next 3.5 seconds at no additional cost.

Recast: Camille mimics the first cast's effects. If Precision Protocol is recast after 1.5 seconds of the first attack, then the bonus damage is doubled, and 55 − 100% (based on level) of the attack's total damage will be dealt as true damage.

Increased Mixed Damage: 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80% AD

Both casts of Precision Protocol reset Camille's basic attack timer.

Camille is able to cast Tactical Sweep, Hookshot, or The Hextech Ultimatum during the windup of Precision Protocol's empowered attack without cancelling it.

Both casts count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive.
Both enhanced attacks cannot critically strike.
The 1.5-second delay is 'fuzzy,' meaning it may take up to another 0.25 seconds to ready the window for the empowered attack.
This syncs up perfectly with Sheen's cooldown between casts at 0 Item Haste, which is also 'fuzzy.'
The second attack will also become empowered if it simply starts after the 1.5-second delay, even if the recast was consumed earlier.
The empowered recast's true damage:
Has a special case to factor Spellblade into the true damage conversion of part of her attack's damage.
Other on-hit effects do not interact with the true damage conversion.
Is not amplified by modifiers that do not increase true damage such as Coup de Grace.
Is reduced by Plated Steelcaps' passive because the partial conversion of the physical damage to true damage happens after the reduction to the physical damage (both are pre-mitigation on-take-damage events).
Is dealt just prior to the physical damage portion of the attack.
Precision Protocol applies to structures but the recast does not convert to true damage.
The enhanced attack will still complete and hit the target even if they become untargetable during the attack's windup.
Warden's Mail's flat damage reduction is reduced on the second cast, reducing the physical damage but not the true damage.

**Tactical Sweep**

**COST:**
50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 Mana
**COOLDOWN:**
17 / 15.5 / 14 / 12.5 / 11 Mana
**CAST TIME:**
none
**EFFECT RADIUS:**
325 / 650
**ANGLE:**
70°

Active: Camille sweeps her leg in a cone in the target direction over 1.1 seconds, during which she is ghosted and unable to declare basic attacks. Afterwards, she deals physical damage to all enemies within.

Physical Damage: 70 / 100 / 130 / 160 / 190 (+ 60% bonus AD)

Enemies hit by the outer half of the cone take additional physical damage, capped at 300 against monsters, and are slowed by 80% decaying over 2 seconds.

Camille is healed for 100% of this additional damage post-mitigation against enemy champions in the outer half.

Outer Cone Bonus Damage: 5 / 5.5 / 6 / 6.5 / 7% (+ 2.5% per 100 bonus AD)

Non-epic monsters take 50% damage from Tactical Sweep.

Non-Epic Monster Damage: 35 / 50 / 65 / 80 / 95 (+ 30% bonus AD)

Bonus Non-Epic Monster Damage: 2.5 / 3 / 3.25 / 3.5 / 3.75% (+ 1.25% per 100 bonus AD) of target's maximum health

Other abilities can be cast during the animation without cancelling it.

Camille can move during the delay, but the hitbox and Camille's visuals are fixed to the initial target direction.
Camille's facing-direction, for effects such as Petrifying Gaze, is the direction she is moving, and not the direction the model is facing.
The 50% damage reduction against non-epic monsters applies after the cap. Because of this, the actual cap against non-epic monsters is 150 damage.
Because the increased damage in the outer range of the cone is dealt as an additional instance of damage (as opposed to bonus damage to the original instance), it will trigger effects twice such as being reduced by Bone Plating an extra time.
(bug)
It still belongs to the same cast instance, therefore it does not trigger additional stacks of Conqueror or Electrocute.

**Hookshot**

**COST:**
70 Mana
**COOLDOWN:**
16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 Mana
**CAST TIME:**
none
**TARGET RANGE:**
800
**WIDTH:**
100

Active: Camille fires a grapple in the target direction. If the grapple collides with terrain, Camille will dash toward and attach to the terrain for 0.75 seconds, during which she gains the ability to cast Wall Dive.

Camille will be knocked down by any immobilizing or polymorphing crowd control, excluding sleep (bug), during the dash.

Other abilities can be cast during the ability. Casting The Hextech Ultimatum will cause the grapple to disappear if it is in flight.

**Wall Dive**

**CAST TIME:**
none
**TARGET RANGE:**
400 / 800
**EFFECT RADIUS:**
130
**SPEED:**
1050 + 100% movement speed

Active: Camille dashes in the target direction, dealing physical damage to enemies near the landing location.

Wall Dive's range is doubled towards enemy champions within 1400 units.

Camille grants ghosting to non-champions she passes through for 4 seconds.

Physical Damage: 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 / 200 (+ 90% bonus AD)

Camille stops prematurely upon colliding with an enemy champion, knocking back all nearby enemy champions, though not through terrain, as well as stunning them for 0.75 seconds, while also gaining bonus attack speed for 5 seconds.

Bonus Attack Speed: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60%

Wall Dive may be also cast with movement or attack commands. Other abilities besides The Hextech Ultimatum can be cast while grappled or during the dash.

Notes
Wall Dive
counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive.
Despite what one might assume from a wall-jumping ability, Wall Dive can be used to go through terrain (including the terrain she is bound to).
Casting Flash during Wall Dive's dash will interrupt it but Camille will affect enemies around the new location.
Wall Dive is disabled while grounded or rooted.
Wall Dive will not automatically cast from movement or attack commands in both cases. While grounded, however, Camille is able to move while bound. She may still dash away from her current location once the grounding finishes.
Camille will only gain a range indicator towards each valid champion within the extended dash range (800), but will still gain the extended dash range without the indicator against enemies within the 1400 range.
She does not have to see any enemy champions to gain the range indicator or extended range.
Displacement immunity will not resist the application of the stun.
If Tactical Sweep is cast during Wall Dive's dash on its opposite direction, the target will be knockback further and to a different direction.
(bug)
The following table refers for interactions while Camille is bound to terrain:

| When Camille is interrupted, she will automatically cast Wall Dive. The only exception is if she was interrupted by casting Flash or Recall, in which case Wall Dive cancels. |

Added
Adaptive Defenses
- Innate
Camille's next basic attack against enemy champions is periodically enhanced to shield her for 20% maximum health against the target's most lethal damage type. If the target is liable to inflict more magic damage than physical damage against Camille, the shield exclusively blocks magic damage, otherwise, the shield exclusively blocks physical damage.
Static Cooldown: 20 / 15 / 10 (based on level)

Precision Protocol
- Q spell
Camille's next basic attack deals 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40% AD bonus physical damage and grants her 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40% bonus movement speed for 1 second.
Precision Protocol can then be recast within the next 3 seconds at no extra cost. If recast at least 1.5 seconds after the first attack, Precision Protocol's damage is doubled and 55 − 100 (based on level)% of the damage is dealt as true damage. Both casts of Precision Protocol reset Camille's auto attack timer.

Cooldown: 9 / 8.25 / 7.5 / 6.75 / 6 Mana
Cost: 25

Tactical Sweep
- W spell
After a brief delay, Camille sweeps her leg to deal 65 / 95 / 125 / 155 / 185 (± 60% bonus AD) physical damage all enemies in a cone in front of her. Enemies hit by the outer half of the cone are slowed by 90%, decaying over 2 seconds, and take 6 / 6.5 / 7 / 7.5 / 8% (± 3% per 100 bonus AD) of target's maximum health bonus physical damage, healing Camille for the same amount, capped at 10% of her maximum health against non-champions. Non-epic monsters take 50% reduced damage from Tactical Sweep.

Cooldown: 15 / 13.5 / 12 / 11 / 10 Mana
Cost: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70

Hookshot
- E spell
First Cast: Camille fires a hookshot in the target direction that attaches to terrain, causing her to dash to it and enabling the second cast.
Second Cast - Wall Dive: Camille dashes to the target location, range doubled if she is leaping toward an enemy champion. Upon colliding with the first enemy struck or finishing the dash, Camille deals 70 / 115 / 160 / 205 / 250 (± 75% bonus AD) physical damage to all nearby enemies and stuns them for 1 second. If Camille strikes an enemy on the second cast of Hookshot, she gains 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80% bonus attack speed for 5 seconds.

Cooldown: 16 / 14.5 / 13 / 12 / 11 Mana
Cost: 50

The Hextech Ultimatum
- R spell
Camille dashes toward the target enemy champion, becoming untargetable during the leap. When she lands, she creates a locked, hexagonal zone around the target for 4 seconds, knocking away all other nearby enemies on impact. The target can move freely inside the zone, but cannot escape it through any means. While within the zone, Camille's basic attacks deal 5 / 10 / 15 (± 4 / 6 / 8% of target's current health) bonus magic damage.

Cooldown: 140 / 115 / 90 Mana
Cost: 100

**Trivia**

[ ]

Camille is one of 20 champions without a single ability power ratio on any ability: Aatrox, Darius, Dr. Mundo, Draven, Garen, Kayn, Kled, Naafiri, Nilah, Olaf, Pyke, Riven, Samira, Sett, Talon, Urgot, Xayah, Yone, and Zed.

Camille was the last champion released in 2016, designed to make players 'feel like in-control badasses.'

Her design bears a very strong resemblance to Lin Beifong from the series Legend of Korra, with similar appearance, profession, and fighting style. She may have also been influenced by Gazelle from the movie Kingsman: The Secret Service.

Camille's passive is so far the only instance of a shield that exclusively protects from physical damage.

Camille is the French derivative of Latin Camilla, feminine form of cognomen Camillus. Camillus/a means 'temple attendant,' and has no Latin root. Earlier forms include Greek Κάδμος-Κάμιλλος-Κᾰσμῖλος-Κᾰδμῖλος, loaned from Pre-Greek *Hatʸmilʸ-*.

[2]

The name Camille could also be a reference to the mythological warrior Camilla who appears in the second half of Vergil's Aeneid on the side of the Rutulians. She is a warrior virgin queen of the Volsci and serves under the goddess Diana. She was said to be so swift-footed she could run through a wheat field without breaking the tops of the stalks and run across the ocean without wetting her feet.

Her clan's name Ferros probably references the Latin word for iron ferrum 'iron'.

[3]

Her dance references the Airflare, a breakdance move. A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. She shares this dance with Kennen. Her dance is very similar to PROJECT: Vayne's, whose dance is a similar breakdance move. A side-by-side comparison of her and PROJECT: Vayne's dances can be seen here. She was first mentioned in pre-rework Evelynn's color story The Shadows Beckon, which is no longer canon.
