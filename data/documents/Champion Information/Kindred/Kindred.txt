**Abilities**

* **Mark of the Kindred**
  * Passive: Lamb and Wolf mark targets to hunt. Scoring a takedown against a hunted target collects a stack of Mark of the Kindred.
  * Lamb: Gains 75-250 (based on marks) bonus range on her basic attacks and Mounting Dread.
  * Innate - Lamb: Lamb is offered a selection of enemy champions to hunt if she has not been in combat with them in the last 6 seconds. Once selected, the mark is applied after an 8-second delay and thereafter it can be collected by Kindred. Lamb gains the ability to select a new target every 75 seconds. Targets successfully hunted cannot be marked again for 4 minutes.
  * Innate - Wolf: Starting at 3:15, Wolf periodically marks a random large monster within the enemy team's jungle for 180 seconds. The hunted camp is highlighted on the minimap to both teams. Once the hunted target is slain or the mark expires, Wolf waits 45 seconds before selecting a new target.
  * The type of monster that Wolf can mark changes based on Kindred's current Mark of the Kindred stacks: 0: Rift Scuttler, 1-3: Rift Scuttler, Crimson Raptor, or Gromp, 4-7: Ancient Krug, Blue Sentinel, Greater Murk Wolf, or Red Brambleback, 8+: Rift Herald or Baron Nashor, Dragon or Elder Dragon.

**Map-Specific Differences**

| Map | Differences |
| --- | --- |
| Nexus Blitz | Jungle camps are no longer marked, On-champion-kill stacks changed to 2, New Effect: Now always grants a stack when killing the Blue Sentinel, Red Brambleback, or Rift Herald. |
| Arena | New Effect: Gains 1 Mark of the Kindred stack per round. |

**Dance of Arrows**

* Cost: 35 Mana
* Cooldown: 9 seconds
* Cast time: none
* Target range: 300
* Effect radius: Kindred's attack range
* Speed: 500 + 100% movement speed
* Active: Lamb dashes toward the target location, gaining 35% (+ 5% per mark) bonus attack speed for 4 seconds and firing an arrow at up to 3 nearby visible enemies that deals physical damage. Her current attack target within any proximity will be prioritized by one of the arrows.
* Physical Damage: 40 / 65 / 90 / 115 / 140 (+ 75% bonus AD)
* Dance of Arrows' total cooldown is reduced to an amount while Lamb is within the area of Wolf's Frenzy. Casting Wolf's Frenzy reduces Dance of Arrows' current cooldown to the same amount.
* Dance of Arrows resets Lamb's basic attack timer. Lamb can cast any of her abilities during the dash. Dance of Arrows will cast at max range if cast beyond that.

**Map-Specific Differences**

| Map | Differences |
| --- | --- |
| Nexus Blitz | Cooldown while in Wolf's Frenzy set to 0.5 seconds. |
| Wolf's Frenzy | Passive: As Kindred move and attack, they build up to 100 stacks of Hunter's Vigor. At maximum stacks, Lamb's next basic attack heals her for 0% − 100% (based on Kindred's missing health) of 47 − 81 (based on level). The heal is not triggered if Kindred is at full health. |
| Arena | Base damage changed to 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30. Bonus AD ratio changed to 10% bonus AD. Health ratio changed to 1% of target's missing health. Damage per mark changed to 0.5%. |

**Mounting Dread**

* Cost: 50 Mana
* Cooldown: 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 seconds
* Cast time: 0.25 seconds
* Target range: 500 − 750 (based on Marks)
* Active: Lamb fires a shot at the target enemy that slows them by 30% (+ 5% per 100 AP) for 1 second and marks them for 4 seconds. Her basic attacks against the marked target each apply a stack, refreshing the duration and stacking up to 3 times. The third stack directs Wolf to pounce on the target, consuming all stacks to deal additional physical damage, capped at 300 against monsters.
* Additional Physical Damage: 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 / 160 (+ 80% bonus AD) (+ 5% (+ 0.5% per Mark) of target's missing health)
* Enhanced damage below threshold: 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 / 160 (+ 80% bonus AD) (+ 7.5% (+ 2.25%) (+ 0.75% (+ 1.75%) per Mark) of target's missing health)
* The additional damage will critically strike against targets below 25% − 75% (based on critical strike chance) of their maximum health, increasing the missing health portion by (50% + 50%), and cannot critically strike otherwise. The base damage of the pounce can independently critically strike.

Separate, but never parted, Kindred represents the twin essences of death. Lamb’s bow offers a swift release from the mortal realm for those who accept their fate. Wolf hunts down those who run from their end, delivering violent finality within his crushing jaws. Though interpretations of Kindred’s nature vary across Runeterra, every mortal must choose the true face of their death.

When the Ashen Lord rose, high priests of the Shadowfire Temple called upon their own god to fend off the all-consuming Infernals. They neglected, however, to account for the being's twin aspects: Destruction, and Rebirth. Kindred will fight the flames, but there may be a bitter price to pay before the end…

The hunter and the hound stalk the runway in white-feathered armor with cerulean plating. The refractions of images that dance in the crystals embossed on both bow and headdress dare the audience to reflect on the past year, their fashion feats, and faux pas.
