**Dragon Practice**

- Innate: Smolder generates a stack of Dragon Practice each time he hits an enemy champion with an ability, or whenever Super Scorcher Breath kills a minion or monster. His basic abilities deal bonus magic damage based on stacks.

---

**Super Scorcher Breath**

- Cost: 23 / 26 / 29 / 32 / 35 mana
- Cooldown: 5.5 / 5 / 4.5 / 4 / 3.5 seconds
- Cast time: 0.25 seconds
- Target range: 550 (+100% bonus range)
- Range: 500
- Effect radius: 285 / 150
- Angle: 15°
- Speed: 1800 / 900

**Passive:** Smolder deals default damage for the burn, spell damage for the fireball, and area damage for the explosions. Smolder can't declare basic attacks for a brief moment after the cast time and only his damage counts for triggering the execute. If the target is below the threshold while afflicted with the burn, they will be executed on the next instance of damage dealt by Smolder, which includes the burn tick. If Super Scorcher Breath would damage the target to below the execution threshold, they are executed on the same damage instance. At 125 Dragon Practice stacks, the fireball will launch 2 bolts. At 225 Dragon Practice stacks, the burn's damage based on the target's health ratio will increase by at least 1.8%, and the execution threshold for the burn will be at least 7.625% of the target's maximum health. Super Scorcher Breath can only hit enemies once per cast. The minion and monster damage modifier applies only to the physical damage. The bolts apply the bonus magic damage from Dragon Practice at 75% damage. This damage does not benefit from life steal. Only Super Scorcher Breath's initial fireball missile can be blocked and dodged. The application of the burn is negated in both cases. The fireball can still explode on-collision and fire the bolts in both cases.

**Q: Dragon Practice**

- Cost: 60 mana
- Cooldown: 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 seconds
- Cast time: 0.35 seconds
- Range: 1500
- Effect radius: 385
- Width: 115
- Speed: 2000 / 400

**Active:** Smolder sneezes a fiery glob in the target direction that deals physical damage to enemies hit and slows them by 35% for 1.5 seconds, slowing down in missile speed after traveling 1200 units. Hitting an enemy champion creates an explosion that deals physical damage to nearby enemies, with subsequent explosions against the same target dealing 75% damage.

**Passive:** Smolder deals 140% damage against minions and monsters.

**W: Flap, Flap, Flap**

- Cost: 65 mana
- Cooldown: 24 / 22 / 20 / 18 / 16 seconds
- Cast time: None
- Range: 700
- Speed: 1800

**Active:** Smolder takes flight for 1.25 seconds, gaining 100% bonus movement speed, unobstructed vision, and the ability to ignore terrain collision. While in flight, he automatically fires up to 5 − 10 (based on critical strike chance) bolts at the nearest and most wounded visible enemy, dealing physical damage with each hit and prioritizing enemy champions.

**Passive:** Flap, Flap, Flap ends immediately if Smolder casts one of his abilities or becomes immobilized. Smolder reveals himself while attacking enemies, even inside terrain. Spell shield will block only one bolt. Self immobilizations such as Zhonya's Hourglass also count for ending Flap, Flap, Flap. Recall is disabled while Smolder is inside terrain. Flap, Flap, Flap can interact with player-generated terrain. If Smolder is inside terrain when the effect ends, he will be placed correspondingly to the nearest valid space. Smolder's attack range is reduced to 0 during Flap, Flap, Flap, further reduced to -203 with Rapid Firecannon.

**R: MMOOOMMMM!**

- Cost: 100 mana
- Cooldown: 120 / 110 / 100 seconds
- Cast time: 0.75 seconds
- Range: 4250 / -600
- Effect radius: 1000
- Width: 125
- Speed: 1700

**Active:** Smolder shouts for his mother to attack from above, causing her to exhale a wave of fire from behind him and towards the target direction, granting sight of its surroundings as it travels. The wave heals Smolder for 110 / 160 / 210 (+75% AP) and deals physical damage to enemies hit, with those in the center taking 30% increased damage and becoming slowed by 40% for 2 seconds.

**Passive:** MMOOOMMMM!'s cooldown starts at the end of the cast time. Smolder can move 0.4 seconds into MMOOOMMMM!'s cast time. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Type, cast time, attacking, abilities, movement, items, usable, and interrupts are disabled while Smolder is flying. N/A is interrupted by death, unless protected by Resurrection. Champion skins []. Smolder is a champion in League of Legends who hides amongst the craggy cliffs of the Noxian frontier, learning what it means to be heir to the Camavoran imperial dragon lineage. Though he's still a fledgling, his skills are nothing to sneeze at, easily setting fire to anything that burns.
