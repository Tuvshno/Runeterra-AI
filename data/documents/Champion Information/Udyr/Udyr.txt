**Abilities**

[ ]

* **Bridge Between**
  * **Innate - Awakened Spirit:** Udyr has no ultimate ability and instead has 4 basic abilities that each incur a 1.5-second global cooldown when cast. Each ability grants a Stance that empowers his next two basic attacks, and switching Stances replaces the empowered attacks from the previous Stance. Periodically, after Udyr enters a Stance, he can recast the ability after 0.25 seconds to enter an Awakened Stance, refreshing the cooldown and the Stance with bonus effects. Awaken is placed on cooldown at the start of the game.
* **Innate - Monk Training:** After casting an ability, Udyr empowers his next two basic attacks within 4 seconds to gain 30% bonus attack speed and refund 5% of Awaken's total cooldown, though not if the remaining cooldown is less than 1 second.

**Static Cooldown:** 50 / 40 / 30 / 20 (based on level) seconds.

---

* **Wilding Claw (Q)**
  * **Active - Stance:** Udyr enters Claw Stance, empowering his next two basic attacks to maul the target, dealing 3 / 4.2 / 5.4 / 6.6 / 7.8 / 9% (+ 4% per 100 bonus AD) of target's maximum health bonus physical damage. Additionally, Udyr gains 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 70% bonus attack speed and deals 5 / 9 / 13 / 17 / 21 / 25 (+ 10% bonus AD) bonus physical damage on-hit for 4 seconds.
  * **Recast - Awaken:** Udyr gains an additional 20% - 70% (based on level) bonus attack speed and causes the empowered attacks to strike with lightning 6 times, dealing magic damage equal to 1.5% - 3% (based on level) (+ 0.6% per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health per hit, chaining to up to 3 nearby visible enemies and being able to hit the same target multiple times. This is capped at 20 (+ 100% bonus AD) (+ 50% AP) against monsters.
  * **Mana Cost:** 45 - 28 (based on level).
  * **Cooldown:** 6 seconds.
  * **Effect Radius:** 450, Cast Time: None.

---

* **Iron Mantle (W)**

Additionally, Udyr gains a shield for 45 / 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 / 120 (+ 40% AP) (+ 2 / 2.6 / 3.2 / 3.8 / 4.4 / 5% maximum health) for 4 seconds.
  * **Recast - Awaken:** Udyr increases the shield's strength to 20 - 150 (based on level) (+ 45 / 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 / 120) (+ 65% AP) (+ 8% maximum health) (stacking with the remaining shield from the first cast), and heals every 0.25 seconds over the next 4 seconds, for a total of 10 - 75 (based on level) (+ 22.5 / 30 / 37.5 / 45 / 52.5 / 60) (+ 32.5% AP) (+ 4% maximum health) , as well as causes the empowered attacks to instead gain 30% life steal and grant doubled healing. Healing on-hit is reduced to 50% against minions.
  * **Mana Cost:** 45 - 28 (based on level).
  * **Cooldown:** 6 seconds.
  * **Cast Time:** None.

---

* **Blazing Stampede (E)**
  * **Active - Stance:** Udyr enters Stampede Stance, empowering his basic attacks to have an uncancellable windup and pounce on the target to stun them for 0.75 seconds. This cannot affect the same target more than once every few seconds. Additionally, Udyr becomes ghosted and gains 30 / 34 / 38 / 42 / 46 / 50% bonus movement speed for 4 seconds, which decays to 30% effectiveness over 1.5 seconds.
  * **Recast - Awaken:** Udyr gains an additional 30% - 40% (based on level) bonus movement speed and immunity to crowd control for 1.5 seconds.
  * **Mana Cost:** 45 - 28 (based on level).

* **Wingborne Storm (R)**
  * **Active - Stance:** Udyr enters Storm Stance, empowering his next two basic attacks to deal 10 - 30 (based on level) (+ 30% AP) bonus magic damage to nearby enemies. Additionally, Udyr summons a blizzard around himself for 4 seconds that deals 10 / 19 / 28 / 37 / 46 / 55 (+ 20% AP) magic damage every 0.5 seconds to nearby enemies and slows them. Minions take 50 / 60 / 70 / 80% (based on level) damage.
  * **Recast - Awaken:** Udyr ends the blizzard if it is active and unleashes a glacial storm for 4 seconds that is able to move on its own. The storm follows the closest nearby visible target and applies the same effects but deals bonus magic damage equal to 1% - 2% (based on level) (+ 0.4375% per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health per tick, capped at 10 - 50 (based on level) (+ 100% bonus AD) (+ 50% AP) against monsters. The storm also slows by an additional 10%. The unleashed storm grants sight of its surroundings and prioritizes following the last enemy Udyr has attacked while he is nearby, then enemy champions, then non-champions, then Udyr.
  * **Mana Cost:** 45 - 28 (based on level).
  * **Cooldown:** 6 seconds.
  * **Effect Radius:** 370 / 1300, Cast Time: None.
