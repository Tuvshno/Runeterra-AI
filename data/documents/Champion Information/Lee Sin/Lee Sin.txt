**Edit**

*Flurry*

Flurry

Innate: After casting an ability, Lee Sin's next 2 basic attacks within 3 seconds gain 40% bonus attack speed and restore energy. The first attack restores 20 / 30 / 40 (based on level) energy and the second attack restores half of the previous amount.

**Details**

*Info*

Targeting input: Passive

Counters: Parries

Flurry will still restore energy even if the attacks are blocked or missed while Lee Sin is blinded, but not dodged.

**Hide**

*Details*

Info: N/A

Targeting input: Auto

Damage type: Physical

Sub-type: Spell damage

Counters: Spell shield

Blocked: Yes

Notes: N/A

**Hide**

*Details*

Info: N/A

Targeting input: Auto

Damage type: Physical

Sub-type: Area damage

Counters: Spell shield

Blocked: Yes

Notes: Tempest's sight reveal only reveals the affected targets, but visually also lights up the Fog of War in a 400 radius. Tempest's sight reveal is not removed when Lee Sin casts Cripple.

This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.

Targeting input: Auto

Counters: Spell shield

Blocked: No

Notes: Tempest's reveal is not removed when Lee Sin casts Cripple.

Cripple cannot be cast without a marked target within 550 range.

The missiles Lee Sin sends out are nowadays missing their visual effects. (bug)

**Hide**

*Details*

Info: N/A

Targeting input: Auto

Damage type: Physical

Sub-type: Minion aggro

Counters: N/A

Applies: Spell damage to the primary target and area damage to secondary targets.

The spell indicator for this ability also displays the direction for the knock back relative to Lee Sin's position.

If the target of Dragon Rage dies initially on the first hit there will be no displacement of any kind.

The displacement's direction is decided at the moment of impact and not by Lee Sin and his target's relative locations at the start of the cast. The only way for Lee Sin to control where his target is displaced is by using Flash before the cast time of Dragon's Rage ends.

If the airborne debuff is removed from the target, its ability to collide with enemies is removed aswell, even if the target has not come to a stop yet. (bug)

The airborne debuff and with it collision of the target remains for the normal duration even if its trajectory is displaced by another source (i.e - Headbutt ).

The knockback distance is intended to be 800, but due to a bug, this is reduced by up-to the sum of Lee Sin's and his target's gameplay radius, depending on how far they are away from one another at the end of the cast time.

If the target becomes untargetable, dies, or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).

A master of Ionia’s ancient martial arts, Lee Sin is a principled fighter who channels the essence of the dragon spirit to face any challenge. Though he lost his sight many years ago, the warrior-monk has devoted his life to protecting his homeland against any who would dare upset its sacred balance. Enemies who underestimate his meditative demeanor will endure his fabled burning fists and blazing roundhouse kicks.

Every now and then, an upstart martial artist climbs the mountain to the monastery near the peak and challenges the blindfolded master who's made his home there. When that happens, those living at the mountain's base know to ready some clean bandages and hot tea—for it won't be long before the challenger returns, utterly defeated.

The traditional garb of Shojin acolytes never sat well on the ambitious shoulders of young Lee Sin, who brimmed with more raw potential than any of his fellow acolytes could ever dream of. And yet, he grew into it: both the garb, and the dragon's power.
