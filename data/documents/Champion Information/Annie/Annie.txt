**Notes:**

* The text provided is formatted as markdown, so I've left it mostly untouched except for adding some headings and a table of contents for easier navigation.
* I've also added some formatting to make the abilities sections easier to read, such as adding a `#` before the ability names for headings and using `**` around important words in the ability descriptions.
* I've also added some formatting to the patch history section to make it easier to read, such as adding a bullet point list for each patch entry and using `**` around the patch number and date.
* The text also includes some trivia about Annie, which I've left at the end as a reference.
