        - Hwei is a brooding painter who creates brilliant art in order to confront Ionia's criminals and comfort their victims. Beneath his melancholy roils a torn, emotional mind—haunted by both the vibrant visions of his imagination and the gruesome memories of his temple's massacre. Hwei seeks to understand this light and dark, which drives him inevitably toward the artist who unraveled him. With paintbrush and palette, Hwei shapes endless possibilities as he draws ever closer to earning closure or embracing despair.

      - **Trivia**
      - Hwei is currently the champion with the largest number of abilities in League of Legends: 11 when excluding his subject selection spells, and 15 when including them.
      - Hwei's kit obeys the rule of thirds in multiple aspects: He has 3 × 3 basic abilities. His passive requires two damaging abilities in order to deal a third damaging ability. He studies two negative subjects and one positive subject. Serenity, Hwei's positive mood, is placed between his other two negative moods, anger and anguish. This fact stems from lore implications, namely his inner turmoil, as detailed in his universe short stories - "Hwei faces the conflicting hues of Ionia" in 'The Visionary' and "Art saves me, yet it can shatter me" in 'Paintings Framed in Half-Light'.
      - When Hwei dies, his eyes, that reflect his current mood, fade into a colorless blankness, symbolizing the absence of any emotional presence in death.
