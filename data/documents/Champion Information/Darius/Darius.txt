* Edit
* Hemorrhage
* Hemorrhage
* Innate: Darius' damaging basic attacks and abilities apply a stack of Hemorrhage to enemies for 5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent applications and stacking up to 5 times.
* Hemorrhage: For each stack, the target is dealt 13-30 (based on level) (+30% bonus AD) total physical damage over the duration, 3.25-7.5 (based on level) (+7.5% bonus AD) physical damage every 1.25 seconds over the duration, up to a maximum of 65-150 (based on level) (+150% bonus AD) total physical damage over the duration. 16-25 (based on level) (+37.5% bonus AD) physical damage with each tick. Hemorrhage deals 300% damage against monsters.
* When Darius kills a champion with Noxian Guillotine, or applies 5 stacks on an enemy champion, he becomes empowered with Noxian Might for 5 seconds.
* Noxian Might: Darius gains 30-230 (based on level) bonus attack damage and instantly applies 5 Hemorrhage stacks through his usual means.
* Blocked: Hemorrhage does not apply to structures nor wards. Darius' attacks and abilities have to deal damage to apply Hemorrhage. Hemorrhage cannot be applied to/refreshed against invulnerable targets. Hemorrhage can be applied on-hit, but will specifically not do so if the target is invulnerable. Spell shield prevents Hemorrhage's application from abilities only.

* Decimate
* Cost: 25/30/35/40/45 mana, Cooldown: 9/8/7/6/5, Cast time: none, Effect radius: 240/460.
* Active: Darius hefts his axe for 0.75 seconds, and then swings it around himself, dealing physical damage to nearby enemies, reduced to 35% against enemies hit by the inner radius.
* Physical Damage: 50/80/110/140/170 (+\[100/110/120/130/140%\] AD).
* Reduced Damage: 17.5/28/38.5/49/59.5 (+\[35/38.5/42/45.5/49%\] AD).
* Against champions and large monsters hit, Darius heals for 15%-45% (based on number of targets hit by the outer radius) of his missing health. Enemies hit by the inner radius do not refresh the duration of or gain a new stack of Hemorrhage.
* Darius is unable to declare basic attacks or cast Apprehend or Noxian Guillotine during Decimate.

* Info: Targeting input: Auto, Damage type: Type: Physical, Sub-type: Area damage.
* Counters: Spell shield, blocked by stasis or Dash during the delay.

* Edit
* Crippling Strike
* Crippling Strike
* Cost: 40 mana, Cooldown: 5 seconds at all ranks, Cast time: none, Active: Darius empowers his next basic attack within 4 seconds to have an uncancellable windup, gain 25 bonus range, deal modified physical damage and slow the target by 90% for 1 second.
* Physical Damage: 140/145/150/155/160% AD.
* If this attack kills the target, half of Crippling Strike's cooldown is reduced and its mana cost is refunded.
* Crippling Strike's total damage is affected by critical strike modifiers.
* Crippling Strike resets Darius's basic attack timer.

* Info: Targeting input: Auto, Damage type: Type: Physical, Sub-type: Spell damage.
* Counters: Spell shield, parries.
* Blocked: Spell shield will not block the damage.
* The attack's animation can be cancelled by casting Decimate, but the attack will still land.
* Crippling Strike triggers Manaflow Band, Tear of the Goddess's Mana Charge and spell effects.
* Despites its name, Crippling Strike no longer cripples anymore.

* Edit
* Apprehend
* Apprehend
* Cost: 70/60/50/40/30 mana, Cooldown: 24/21.5/19/16.5/14 seconds, Cast time: 0.25 seconds, Passive: Darius gains armor penetration.
* Armor Penetration: 20/25/30/35/40%.
* Active: Darius sweeps his axe in a cone in the target direction, granting sight of the area for 1 second while pulling enemies hit towards him. Upon arrival, they rebound 150 units off of him, remaining airborne and becoming slowed by 40% for 1 second.
* Darius is unable to move or cast Decimate or Noxian Guillotine for 0.4 seconds after Apprehend's cast time.
* Video: [Link].
* Details: [Link].
* Video: [Link].
* Info: Targeting input: Direction, Counters: Spell shield, projectile, not blocked.
* Enemies hit by Apprehend will quickly be dragged to Darius before rebounding over a longer period.
* The slow duration starts as soon as the target rebounds off of Darius.
* Pending for test: The rebound location is determined when the target reaches Darius's location.
* The rebound's forced movement's duration is roughly 0.5 seconds, finishing before the airborne duration ends.
* Pending for test: There is no stun applied for the same duration of the airborne, meaning brittle cannot extend the disable duration. It will not increase the slow duration in most situations because of the negative tenacity falling off before the slow is applied.
* After the pull, Darius will attempt to basic attack the closest pulled target, prioritizing enemy champions.
* The armor penetration stacks multiplicatively with other forms of percentage armor penetration.
* This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
* Type: Cast time: Attacking, Disabled: Abilities, Movement, Items, Usable: Shurelya's Battlesong, Youmuu's Ghostblade, Randuin's Omen, Disabled: All other item-actives, Interrupted by: N/A, Consumables: Usable: Barrier, Clarity, Cleanse, Exhaust, Ghost, Heal, Ignite, Smite, Disabled: Flash, Teleport, Recall, Hexflash, Interrupted by: N/A, Interrupted by: Death, unless protected by Resurrection.

* Noxian Guillotine
* Noxian Guillotine
* Cost: 100/100/0 mana, Cooldown: 120/100/80 seconds, Cast time: 0.3667 seconds, Target range: 475.
* Active: Darius attempts to execute the target enemy champion, leaping towards them to deal true damage, increased by 0%-100% (based on Hemorrhage stacks), and granting sight of the area around them for 2.5 seconds from the start of the cast time.
* True Damage: 125/250/375 (+\[75%\] bonus AD).
* Bonus Damage Per Stack: 25/50/75 (+\[15%\] bonus AD).
* Maximum True Damage: 250/500/750 (+\[150%\] bonus AD).
* If the target dies within 0.15 seconds after being hit by Noxian Guillotine, Darius fears nearby minions and monsters for 3 seconds, during which they are gradually slowed by up to 99% over the duration. He can also recast the ability within 20 seconds at no cost, which refreshes on further executions.
* At rank 3, Noxian Guillotine has no mana cost and recast timer.
* Darius is unable to cast Decimate or Apprehend for 0.25 seconds after Noxian Guillotine's cast time.
* Video: [Link].
* Details: [Link].
* Info: Targeting input: Unit, Target out-of-range override, Walk in range of the target.
* Damage type: Type: Minion aggro, Spell damage, True.
* Counters: Spell shield, grounded, kn
ockdown, disabled, not interrupted.
* Noxian Guillotine's cooldown after the recast or recast window is calculated by taking the values at the end, and using this formula: (Noxian Guillotine's Cooldown - time since first cast)×100÷(100+AH).
* Darius will only leap towards the target if it is at range, or leap backwards if it is very close.
* This leap can pass very thin terrain and will otherwise not be able to. In any case, Darius will still hit the target.
* The ability is disabled while grounded or rooted even if Darius is in the range in which he does not leap.
* Noxian Guillotine will not reset nor trigger Noxian Might if used to kill a clone or a target protected by resurrection.
* Noxian Guillotine will reset but not trigger Noxian Might if it finishes off a target that is in a zombie state.
* If the target becomes untargetable, dies, or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).

* There is no greater symbol of Noxian might than Darius, the nation’s most feared and battle-hardened leader. Rising from humble origins to become the Hand of Noxus, he cleaves through the empire's enemies—many of them Noxians themselves. Knowing that he never doubts his cause is just, and never hesitates once his axe is raised, those who stand against the commander of the Trifarian Legion can expect no mercy.
