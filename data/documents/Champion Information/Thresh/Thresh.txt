**Gameplay**

* Damnation
	+ Effect Radius: 1900
	+ Innate: Thresh's armor cannot increase through growth (per level)
	+ Innate: Enemy champions, large minions, and large monsters that die near Thresh drop a Soul for 8 seconds. Epic monsters drop 2 Souls while lesser minions and monsters have a 33.3% chance to drop a Soul. Thresh automatically collects Souls near him or a placed Dark Passage. Each stack grants Thresh 1 ability power and 1 bonus armor.
	+ Soul: For each stack, Thresh gains 1 ability power and 1 bonus armor.
	+ Map-Specific Differences:
		- Howling Abyss: Each collected soul counts as 2 from 1.
		- Nexus Blitz: Each collected soul counts as 2 from 1.
		- Ultra Rapid Fire: Grants 3 souls per pick-up.
		- Arena: New Effect: Gains 11.25 Soul stacks per round.
* Death Sentence
	+ Cost: 70 Mana
	+ Cooldown: 19 / 16.5 / 14 / 11.5 / 9 seconds
	+ Cast Time: 0.5 seconds
	+ Range: 1100 / 1040
	+ Effect Radius: Global (3000)
	+ Width: 140
	+ Speed: 1900 / 1400
	+ Active: Thresh throws out his scythe in the target direction, becoming unable to move or attack while it is in flight. The scythe catches the first enemy hit, dealing magic damage and stunning and revealing them for 1.5 seconds. Thresh will also mark the target Shackled for 1.5 seconds, during which he is unable to declare basic attacks and is slowed by 20% for 1 second.
	+ Magic Damage: 100 / 150 / 200 / 250 / 300 (± 90% AP)
	+ While the target is stunned, Thresh tugs twice over 0.8 seconds, pulling the target a short distance with each tug. After 0.5 seconds of hitting an enemy or instantly after hitting a minion or monster, Thresh can recast the ability while the target is Shackled, causing him to dash to the Shackled enemy, becoming able to attack again upon arrival. He can cast Dark Passage and Flay during the dash.
	+ Map-Specific Differences:
		- AoE (Arena): Thresh can dash to a random enemy instead of a Shackled enemy.
		- Nexus Blitz: Thresh gains 10 bonus attack damage for the duration of Death Sentence.
		- Ultra Rapid Fire: Thresh can only chain a maximum of 5 targets with Death Sentence.

**Tips & Tricks**

* The dashing ally will track Thresh if he changes locations.
* They will dash to Thresh's previous location if he is too far away or moves beyond 2200 units.
* The lantern is considered a unit and can be targeted by an allied Teleport, Leap Strike, Shunpo, and Safeguard.
* It is untargetable to enemies.
* The lantern's duration and maximum leash range are each displayed as a circle on the ground.
* Thresh will gain Dark Passage's shield from moving out of leash range of the lantern.
* Dark Passage is special-cased to trigger Guardian.
* Since the ally needs to select the lantern, enemies may create targetable units on top of the lantern to impede allies from grabbing it (i.e. Warding Totem).
* Thresh's Flay passive now applies on-hit effects and can critically strike as normal.
* The enhanced attack will not trigger against structures nor wards.
* Pending for Test: Enhanced attack interactions with blinding effects (regarding both bonus damage and charge reset).

**Champion Skins**

* Original
* Sadistic and cunning, Thresh is an ambitious and restless spirit of the Shadow Isles. Once the custodian of countless arcane secrets, he was undone by a power greater than life or death, and now sustains himself by tormenting and breaking others with slow, excruciating inventiveness. His victims suffer far beyond their brief mortal coil as Thresh wreaks agony upon their souls, imprisoning them in his unholy lantern to torture for all eternity.

* With every soul the Ruination seized, Thresh's lantern burned brighter. He had planned for this moment, after all: the chance to scour far beyond the Shadow Isles, the Mist's reach so much greater than his own. Reaping all he had so meticulously sown, Thresh was at last unbound from the shackles of the isles. He had forgotten how good it feels to have skin...
