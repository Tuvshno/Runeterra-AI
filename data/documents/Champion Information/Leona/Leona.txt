Sunlight

Sunlight (Passive)

Info

Targeting input: Passive

Damage type: Type: Spell damage, Sub-type: Magic

Counters: Spell shield (Blocked)

Sunlight's mark damage is credited to the allied champion and not to Leona. The damage will benefit from allies' magic penetration and will apply any spell effects and spell vamp they have.

**Pending for Test:**

: Omnivamp, Zyra has a hidden passive that grants her 10% increased size for 33 seconds after having Sunlight applied to her.

Shield of Daybreak

Shield of Daybreak (Q)

Cost: 35 / 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 Mana

Cooldown: 5 seconds

Cast time: none

Active: Leona illuminates her shield, empowering her next basic attack within 6 seconds to have a 0.25-second cast time, gain 50 bonus range, deal bonus magic damage, and stun the target for 1 second.

Bonus Magic Damage: 10 / 35 / 60 / 85 / 110 (+ 30% AP)

Shield of Daybreak resets Leona's basic attack timer.

Info

Targeting input: Auto

Damage type: Type: Spell damage, Sub-type: Magic

Counters: Spell shield (Parries), Missing (Blocked)

The enhanced attack will apply other on-hit effects and can critically strike as normal. Critical strikes do not interact with Shield of Daybreak's bonus damage.

**Pending for Test:**

: Shield of Daybreak's interactions with dodging, blocking, and blinding effects.

Shield of Daybreak's attack does not put Leona's basic attack on cooldown.

(bug)

This effectively performs a second attack reset.

Probably not a bug because her High Noon skin gives the second attack a new distinguishable attack animation, which means that it's designed so.

If the target becomes untargetable, dies, or is too far away during the empowered attack's cast time, it is cancelled but not consumed.

The empowered attack will not trigger against buildings.

Trivia

[ ]

Leona's dance resembles 'Shield Break' by the Force Shielder from Cabal Online.

Sunlight and Illumination have nearly identical functionality, with the only differences being who (Leona's allies and Lux herself, respectively) and what (any allied damage source and Lux's basic attacks, respectively) triggers them.

Sunlight deals 1 less damage to champions wearing sunglasses (whether by default like Vayne or through a skin like Riot Graves or Surfer Singed).

Leona is the modern feminine derivative of Ancient Greek name Leon Λέων 'lion', from an Afro-Asiatic source [2] (cf. Proto-Semitic *labuʔ ~ *labiʔ).

Her title 'the Radiant Dawn' might be referencing Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn & Hausos, the PIE Dawn Goddess.

A functional real-life replica of Leona's Zenith Blade was crafted in an episode of YouTube series Man At Arms: Reforged .

This video can be viewed here .

There are also episodes where they crafted: Diana's Crescent Moonblade (functional), Katarina's Daggers (functional), Master Yi's 'Highlander' Ring Sword (functional), Poppy's Hammer of Orlon (functional), Yasuo's 'Last Breath' Sword (functional), and Ziggs' Hexplosive Bomb (prop).
