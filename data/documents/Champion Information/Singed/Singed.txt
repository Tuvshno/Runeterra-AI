    * Trivia
      * Singed was one of the first six champions designed, together with Annie, Lee Sin, Sion, Sivir, and Twisted Fate.
      * Singed is an anagram for the word 'design,' befitting his history of being one of the earliest designed champions.
      * Singed was one of the champions chosen for the Noxian pool available during the Ionia vs. Noxus match. He was one of the selected champions.
      * Singed's dance references Will Smith's 'Jump on It' dance from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
      * A side-by-side comparison of Singed's dance with Kayle's can be seen here.
      * Singed shares this dance with Kayle before her rework, though hers includes the beginning of the dance.
      * Even though Poison Trail's cloud appears to expand as it fades, the area affected by the poison does not actually increase.
      * Singed is one of the few champions with a special interaction between his emotes and his ability set, as Fling automatically causes him to laugh.
      * Although Singed holds his shield in his left hand in the default splash art, every other skin shows it in his right hand; Singed holds his shield in his right hand in all the in-game models.
      * A bottle of Singed's poison can be seen leaking in the Mac Launch preview video.
