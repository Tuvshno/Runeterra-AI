  * Whenever a turret outside the enemy team's base is destroyed, a marker is placed above its ruins which can be targeted by Azir.
  * Inner turret functions the same as a standard inner turret but deals magic damage, gains 40% AP bonus attack damage, and grants its kill credit to Azir.
  * The Sun Disc's health decays over 45 seconds and loses 100 armor and 100 magic resistance while Azir is not alive or is too far away.

      * Azir periodically stocks a Sand Soldier, up to a maximum of 2.
      * When Azir declares a basic attack against an enemy in a soldier's attack range, the Sand Soldier attacks in his stead, thrusting their spear in the target's direction to deal magic damage to enemies struck in a line and applying on-hit and on-attack effects against the primary target at 50% effectiveness.

***Azir**'s Lore:***

Azir was a mortal emperor of Shurima in a far distant age, a proud man who stood at the cusp of immortality. His hubris saw him betrayed and murdered at the moment of his greatest triumph, but now, millennia later, he has been reborn as an Ascended being of immense power. With his buried city risen from the sand, Azir seeks to restore Shurima to its former glory.
