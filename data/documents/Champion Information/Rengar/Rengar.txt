**Abilities**

**Edit**

* **Unseen Predator**
  * TARGET RANGE: 50
  * RANGE: 745
  * SPEED: 1450
  * Innate
    * Rengar generates 1 Ferocity upon casting a basic ability or using Savagery's first attack.
    * At 4 Ferocity, his next basic ability consumes them all to become empowered with an additional effect and grant him an additional cast along with 30 / 40 / 50% (based on level) bonus movement speed for 1.5 seconds.
    * Reaching 4 Ferocity with Savagery or Bola Strike locks them from use for 0.1 seconds before and after casting.
    * All Ferocity is lost after 10 seconds of being out of combat.
  * Innate: While in brush, Rengar gains Unseen Predator, which lingers for 0.35 seconds upon exiting brush. Unseen Predator is lost immediately if Rengar exits the brush using Flash or Hexflash.
  * Unseen Predator: Rengar's basic attacks have massively increased range and cause him to leap to the target's location, attacking the target upon arrival and landing closer than his normal melee range. Unseen Predator will generate 1 Ferocity on-hit if none of his current Ferocity was generated this way. Ferocity generated by Unseen Predator has a distinct color. Rengar can cast any of his abilities during the dash.
  * Inner Bonetooth Necklace: Scoring a takedown against an enemy champion within 3 seconds of damaging them grants Rengar a Trophy, once per unique champion and up to 5. An additional Trophy is made available through the event The Hunt is On! Trophies grant bonus attack damage equal to 1% − 36% (based on Trophies) bonus AD.

**Thrill of the Hunt**

* COOLDOWN: 110 / 100 / 90
* CAST TIME: none
* EFFECT RADIUS: 2500 / 3000 / 3500
* Detection Radius: 710
* Passive: Rengar also gains Unseen Predator while camouflaged from any source.
* Active: Rengar prowls for a duration, gaining bonus movement speed. After a 2-second delay, he also becomes camouflaged.
* Duration: 12 / 16 / 20
* Bonus Movement Speed: 40 / 50 / 60%
* During this time, Rengar will detect the nearest enemy champion in range, revealing and gaining sight of a 100-unit radius around them. Enemies detected are revealed for the remaining full duration. The nearest detected enemy within 1600 range is also marked, alerting all of their allies within 1200 range about Rengar's presence.
* Rengar's next basic attack within normal attack range against any enemy or with Unseen Predator to the marked enemy deals 50% AD bonus physical damage and inflicts armor reduction for 4 seconds.
* Attacking or casting abilities, other than Savagery, ends Thrill of the Hunt immediately.
