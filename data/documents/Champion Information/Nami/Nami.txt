A headstrong young vastaya of the seas, Nami was the first of the Marai tribe to leave the waves and venture onto dry land, when their ancient accord with the Targonians was broken. With no other option, she took it upon herself to complete the sacred ritual that would ensure the safety of her people. Amidst the chaos of this new age, Nami faces an uncertain future with grit and determination, using her Tidecaller staff to summon the strength of the oceans themselves.

Nami doesn't quite understand the concept of Urf, but was told to don her apparel in honor of the great manatee known as Urf. She's happy to lounge around with her fellow manatee and manatee aficionados, but is quite perplexed as to why she's being shot out of a cannon.
