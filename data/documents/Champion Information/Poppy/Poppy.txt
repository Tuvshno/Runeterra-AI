* Position(s): Top, Jungle
* Resource: Mana

**Iron Ambassador**

* Passive: Periodically, Poppy's next basic attack is empowered to throw her buckler, gaining 350 bonus range and dealing 20 − 180 (based on level) bonus magic damage. After it hits, the buckler then falls to a location near the target over 1 second, landing and remaining there for up to 4 seconds. Poppy can move over the buckler to retrieve it, gaining a shield for 13 / 15.5 / 18.5 / 21.5 / 25.5 of her maximum health for 3 seconds. If the buckler kills the target, or if the target is already dead when the buckler hits it, the buckler will bounce back to Poppy instead of falling. Enemy champions can move over the buckler to destroy it.
