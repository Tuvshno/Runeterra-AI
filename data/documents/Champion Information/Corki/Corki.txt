**Trivia**
[3]

* Corki is voiced by an individual named "Ralph"
* It was speculated that Corki was inspired by Aurel Vlaicu the Gyrocopter from Dota 2, but this has been proven false.
* Corki was the first champion to have two Legendary skins as well as the first and only to have three. All of them are old skins that are either Legacy or were never for sale to begin with.
* Corki's dance references the "Do a barrel roll!" phrase spoken by Peppy Hare in Star Fox 64.
* In the now-removed official League of Legends forums, the old sound effect for when Corki picks up The Package was similar to an air raid siren, which was pointed out by a player in Syria and promptly changed.
