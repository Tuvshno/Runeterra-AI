  * Be announced directly through an "Art Spotlight"
  * Be available for play on the PBE before her official release
  * Have her own login screen and dedicated theme
* Lulu was the last champion to release with 2 skins alongside her Classic one.
* Whimsy, Help, Pix!, Lamb's Respite, Tempered Fate, and Time Warp are the only abilities in the game that can affect themselves, allies, and enemies.
* Lulu's abilities grant buffs and debuffs depending if her target is an ally or an enemy.
* Using Help, Pix! on an enemy will grant them a debuff reading 'Hey! Listen!' referencing Navi from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.
* In chat, the enemy player's character name is replaced by "Harmless Critter" while they are polymorphed by Whimsy.
* Before V11.1, this changed name would range along a number of possible ones, depending on Lulu's skin: Squill, Cupcake, Kitty, Dragon, Snowman, Blob, Jelly, and Blob.
