**Living Battery (Innate)**

* Innate: Zeri absorbs the energy of shields she damages, shielding herself equal to 60% of the post-mitigation damage dealt to the shield. Each instance of shield gained by Living Battery lasts for 3 seconds.
* Innate: Whenever Zeri receives a shield, she gains 10% bonus movement speed for 3 seconds.

**Burst Fire (Q)**

* Passive: Zeri's slow application from a charged basic attack has its strength increased to 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40%.
* Active: Zeri fires a burst of 7 rounds in the target direction that deal a total of 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 (+110% AD) physical damage to the first enemy hit. Burst Fire's effects are treated as a basic attack; it can hit any enemy unit a typical basic attack can, deals basic damage, can critically strike for (82.5% + 55%) AD bonus damage, and apply on-hit and on-attack effects at 100% effectiveness once on each target struck. Burst Fire's cooldown and cast time scale down with attack speed, with the maximum of 1.5 attacks per second. 50% of attack speed in excess of the cap is converted into bonus attack damage.
* Cost: None
* Cooldown: (1/ Zeri's attack speed) seconds.
* Range: 825
* Width: 80
* Speed: 2600 / 3400

**Ultrashock Laser (W)**

* Active: Zeri fires an electric pulse in the target direction that deals 40 / 75 / 110 / 145 / 180 (+100% AD) (±60% AP) magic damage to the first enemy hit and slows them by 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70% for 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2 seconds. If the pulse collides with terrain, it transforms into a laser in a line from the point of impact that grants sight of the area for 1.75 seconds and fires after 0.75 seconds, applying the same effects to all enemies caught within.
* Mana Cost: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90.
* Cooldown: 10 seconds.
* Range: 1200 / 1500
* Width: 80 / 200
* Speed: 2200 / Instant

**Spark Surge (E)**

* Active: Zeri dashes in the target direction. Afterwards, she empowers her next 3 casts of Burst Fire within 6 seconds, causing them to pierce through enemies, though dealing 80 / 85 / 90 / 95 / 100% damage after the first and not applying attack effects to secondary targets. This damage is affected by critical strike modifiers.
* Zeri will dash farther across terrain if Spark Surge was cast within 50 units of any, gaining unobstructed vision of the surrounding 800 units and revealing herself while there are enemy champions within 800 units of her.
* Spark Surge's cooldown is reduced by 1.5 seconds for every champion Zeri hits with charged basic attacks or abilities.
* Spark Surge resets Zeri's basic attack timer and Burst Fire's cooldown.
* Zeri can cast Ultrashock Laser and Lightning Crash while dashing.
* Mana Cost: 80.
* Cooldown: 23 / 21.5 / 20 / 18.5 / 17 seconds.
* Range: 300
* Speed: 600 + 100% movement speed
* Cast Time: None.

**Lightning Crash (R)**

* Active: Zeri discharges a nova of electricity around her, dealing 150 / 250 / 350 (+80% bonus AD) (±80% AP) magic damage to all nearby enemies.
* If Lightning Crash hits at least one enemy champion, Zeri becomes Overcharged for 6 seconds, and gains 3 stacks of Overcharge per champion hit. Each stack grants her 2% bonus movement speed. She gains a stack of Overcharge each time she hits an enemy champion with a charged basic attack or ability, refreshing the duration of Overcharge by 2 seconds in the process.
* While Overcharged, Zeri gains 30 / 35 / 40% bonus attack speed and deals 10 / 20 / 30 (+15% AP) bonus magic damage on-hit, and empowers Burst Fire to instead fire 3 rounds over a 20% shorter cast time that are electrified and traveling with increased speed. These rounds deal the bonus magic damage to the target struck and the closest visible enemy, chaining up to 4 subsequent targets. Secondary targets are dealt 25% AD physical damage, which can critically strike for (43.75% + 26.25%) AD physical damage.
* Mana Cost: 100.
* Cooldown: 100 / 90 / 80 seconds.
* Effect Radius: 825
* Cast Time: 0.25 seconds.
