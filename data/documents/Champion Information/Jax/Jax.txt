### Abilities

#### **Relentless Assault** (Passive)

* Jax's basic attacks generate a stack of Relentless Assault on-attack for 2.5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent attacks and stacking up to 8 times. Stacks expire by one every 0.25 seconds when the duration ends.
* For each stack, Jax gains 3.5% - 11% (based on level) bonus attack speed.

#### **Grandmaster at Angling** (Passive)

* While out-of-combat with champions and idle in the river for 10 seconds, Jax will occasionally catch a fish, granting him 1 and 1 ability power for 5 seconds. He catches a fish at an average rate of one every 15 seconds. He also has a 5% chance to catch a rare fish that grants 10 and 10 ability power for 5 seconds.
* Jax catching a fish is a random event and will play a special animation.
* The total number of fish caught during the game is displayed when fishing as Grandmaster at Angling passive.
