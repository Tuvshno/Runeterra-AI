**Mana Barrier**

*Mana Barrier*
*STATIC*
*COOLDOWN: 90*
*Innate: Periodically, when damaged to 30% maximum health, Blitzcrank generates a shield equal to 30% of maximum mana, lasting up to 10 seconds.*
*Targeting input: Passive*
*The shield will absorb the portion of incoming damage that would reduce health past 30%.*
*Map-Specific Differences: Arena differences*
*Video*
*Info: Targeting input, Passive, The shield will absorb the portion of incoming damage that would reduce health past 30%.*

*Video: https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Blitzcrank_IVideo.ogv*

**Rocket Grab**

*Rocket Grab*
*COST: 100 mana*
*COOLDOWN: 20 / 19 / 18 / 17 / 16*
*CAST TIME: 0.25*
*Active: Blitzcrank fires their right hand in the target direction that catches the first enemy hit, dealing them magic damage, stunning them for 0.65 seconds, and pulling them towards Blitzcrank, during which they are revealed.*
*Magic Damage: 105 / 150 / 195 / 240 / 285 (+ 120% AP)*
*Blitzcrank is unable to move or attack while Rocket Grab is in flight.*
*Targeting input: Direction*
*Damage type: Type, Sub-type: Spell damage, Magic*
*Counters: Spell shield, Projectile, Blocked, Blocked*
*Rocket Grab's range is composed of a missile with 1080 range, and a smaller center-range area check at the end (colloquially known as a 'lollipop').*
*The area check is currently half as long as it is supposed to be, reducing the intended 1150 range of the ability to 1115 range.*
*Hitting an enemy with this area check only also fails to play the ability's hit SFX. This makes it possible to easily distinguish whether the target was picked up by the missile collision or 'lollipop'.*
*Targets larger than 95 units in radius can be hit by a different edge-range circle check at the end of the missile.*
*The airborne debuff lasts for up to 1 second but will end prematurely when the target's movement stops, while the stun will persist (if duration permits).*
*Displacement immunity will not resist the application of the stun.*
*The target's destination lies 75 units in front of Blitzcrank.*
*If the target is closer than this, the effect will still move them to this location.*
*If Blitzcrank is being moved (e.g. Airborne, Kinematics, or Fate's Call) during the grab, the target will be pulled towards Blitzcrank's old location.*
*Blitzcrank will be ordered to basic attack the target once the target arrives.*
*If the target dies to Rocket Grab's damage, they will not be pulled.*
*This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.*
*Type: Cast time, Attacking, Disabled, Abilities, Disabled, Movement, Disabled, Items, Usable, Spells, Usable, Interrupted by, Interrupted by, Interrupted by, Resurrection*

*Video: https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Blitzcrank_QVideo.ogv*

**Overdrive**

*Overdrive*
*COST: 75 mana*
*COOLDOWN: 15*
*CAST TIME: none*
*Active: Blitzcrank shifts into overdrive, gaining bonus attack speed for 5 seconds and bonus movement speed that decays to 10% over the first 2.9 seconds.*
*Bonus Attack Speed: 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 70%*
*Bonus Movement Speed: 70 / 75 / 80 / 85 / 90%*
*When Overdrive ends, Blitzcrank is slowed by 30% for 1.5 seconds.*
*Targeting input: Auto*
*Damage type: Type, Sub-type: Proc damage, Magic*
*Counters: Parries, Blocked*
*The movement speed boost's decay is linear. On the first stat update after the buff is gained, the boost does not decay.*
*The self-slow is affected by slow resist and Tenacity.*
*Video: https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Blitzcrank_WVideo.ogv*

**Power Fist**

*Power Fist*
*COST: 25 mana*
*COOLDOWN: 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 / 5*
*CAST TIME: none*
*Active: Blitzcrank empowers their next basic attack within 5 seconds to have an uncancellable windup, deal 80% AD (+ 25% AP) bonus physical damage, and knock up the target for 1 second. This damage is affected by critical strike modifiers.*
*Power Fist resets Blitzcrank's basic attack timer.*
*Targeting input: Auto*
*Damage type: Type, Sub-type: Spell damage, Physical*
*Counters: Spell shield, Parries, See Notes*
*The knockup is applied even if the attack is dodged or missed.*
*It is not applied if it is blocked.*
*Spell shield prevents the knockup but not the damage. The enhanced attack will still complete and hit the target even if they become untargetable during the attack's windup.*
*The target is displaced a short distance during the knockup in a random direction.*
*Video: https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Blitzcrank_EVideo.ogv*

**Static Field**

*Static Field*
*COST: 100 mana*
*COOLDOWN: 60 / 40 / 20*
*CAST TIME: 0.25*
*Passive: While Static Field is not on cooldown, Blitzcrank's basic attacks apply a stack to the target on-hit.*
*After every 1 second, one stack is consumed to deal them magic damage.*
*Magic Damage: 50 / 100 / 150 (+ 30 / 40 / 50% AP) (+ 2% maximum mana)*
*Active: Blitzcrank detonates a static field that destroys the damage-mitigating shields of all nearby enemies, excluding the shields of monsters, and then deals them magic damage and silences them for 0.5 seconds.*
*Magic Damage: 275 / 400 / 525 (+ 100% AP)*
*Targeting input: Auto*
*Damage type: Type, Sub-type: See Notes, Magic*
*Counters: Spell shield, Blocked*
*Blitzcrank's attacks do not have to deal damage to apply the mark. The mark will be consumed even if the target becomes untargetable.*
*The lightning bolts deal spell damage while the static field applies area damage.*
*Even if Static Field is blocked by a spell shield, it will still destroy any existing damage shields on the target.*
*The visual effects will appear from wherever Blitzcrank is at the end of the cast time.*

*Blitzcrank is an enormous, near-indestructible automaton from Zaun, originally built to dispose of hazardous waste. However, he found this primary purpose too restricting, and modified his own form to better serve the fragile people of the Sump. Blitzcrank selflessly uses his strength and durability to protect others, extending a helpful metal fist or burst of energy to subdue any troublemakers.*
