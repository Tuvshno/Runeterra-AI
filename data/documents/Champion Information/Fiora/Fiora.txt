**Abilities**

* **Duelist's Dance**
  * Effect Radius: 1200 / 1350
  * Angle: 90°
  * Inherent: Fiora identifies the Vitals of nearby visible enemy champions, marked as an arc around them in North-, East-, South- or Westward direction.
  * Vitals take 1.75 seconds to become targetable and linger for 13.25 seconds afterwards while Fiora remains near the target. Otherwise, the Vital will disappear.
  * After a Vital ends, Fiora identifies a new one on her target.
  * Dealing damage in the direction of a Vital will trigger it to deal bonus true damage equal to 3% (+ 4% per 100 bonus AD) of target's maximum health, heal Fiora for 35 − 100 (based on level), and grant her 20 / 30 / 40 / 50% (based on Grand Challenge's Rank) bonus movement speed that decays over 1.85 seconds.

* **Lunge**
  * Cost: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 Mana
  * Cooldown: 13 / 11.25 / 9.5 / 7.75 / 6 seconds
  * Cast Time: none
  * Target Range: 50 / 400
  * Range: 420
  * Speed: See notes
  * Active: Fiora dashes in the target direction, then stabs a nearby enemy. Lunge can hit structures and wards. Stabbing a target reduces Lunge's cooldown by 50%.
  * The stab deals physical damage and applies on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness.
  * Physical Damage: 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 (+ 90 / 95 / 100 / 105 / 110% bonus AD)
  * Fiora can cast any of her abilities during the dash. The target does not have to be visible to be hit by this ability.

* **Riposte**
  * Cost: 50 Mana
  * Cooldown: 24 / 22 / 20 / 18 / 16 seconds
  * Cast Time: none
  * Target Range: 900
  * Width: 140
  * Speed: 3200
  * Active: Fiora enters a defensive stance for 0.75 seconds, becoming unable to act, preventing all incoming non-turret damage, and gaining debuff immunity and crowd control immunity.
  * Additionally, over the first 0.6 seconds of the duration, Fiora poises to strike, after which she sends a shock with her sword in a line in the target direction, dealing magic damage to all enemies hit until colliding with an enemy champion.
  * Magic Damage: 110 / 150 / 190 / 230 / 270 (+ 100% AP)
  * The enemy champion struck is also slowed and crippled by 25% for 2 seconds.
  * If Riposte negates at least one hostile immobilizing effect, Fiora stuns the target for the same duration instead.

* **Bladework**
  * Cost: 40 Mana
  * Cooldown: 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 / 7 seconds
  * Cast Time: none
  * Active: Fiora empowers her next two basic attacks on-attack within 4 seconds to gain 25 bonus range and bonus attack speed.
  * Bonus Attack Speed: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90%
  * The first attack slows the target by 30% for 1 second but cannot critically strike. The second attack will critically strike for modified critical damage, including to structures.
  * Critical damage: 160 / 170 / 180 / 190 / 200%
  * Bladework resets Fiora's basic attack timer.

* **Grand Challenge**
  * Cost: 100 Mana
  * Cooldown: 110 / 90 / 70 seconds
  * Cast Time: none
  * Target Range: 500
  * Effect Radius: 550 / 500
  * Passive: Duelist's Dance's bonus movement speed is increased.
  * Additional Bonus Movement Speed: 10 / 20 / 30%
  * Active: Fiora challenges the target enemy champion for 8 seconds, highlighting all four of their Vitals after a 0.5-second delay. While in effect, Fiora gains Duelist's Dance's bonus movement speed.
  * If Fiora triggers at least one Vital before the target dies or triggers all four, she creates a Victory Zone at their location for 2 − 5 (based on Vitals hit) seconds, which heals Fiora and all allies within the area every second.
  * Heal per Tick: 75 / 100 / 125 (+ 60% bonus AD)
  * Maximum Heal: 375 / 500 / 625 (+ 300% bonus AD)
  * Unlike Duelist's Dance, the Vitals will continue to linger even if Fiora is not nearby.
