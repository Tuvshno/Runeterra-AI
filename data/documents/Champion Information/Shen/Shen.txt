**Abilities**

* **[ ]**

**Edit**

* **Ki Barrier**
* **Ki Barrier**
* **STATIC**
* **COOLDOWN:** 10
* **Innate:** After completing an ability's effects, Shen grants himself a shield for 50 − 101 (based on level) (+ 12% bonus health) for 2.5 seconds. If Shen affects at least one other champion with an ability, Ki Barrier's cooldown is reduced by 4 − 7.5 (based on level) seconds. Shen manifests a Spirit Blade that he can control with Twilight Assault and Spirit's Refuge.

---

* **Details**
* **Info**
* **Targeting input:** Passive
* **The Spirit Blade spawns with Shen, teleports closer to him if he gets too far away, and instantly blinks to him if he uses any global blink (Teleport, Recall, or Stand United). It will also dissappear if Shen dies and reappear upon respawning. Enemies see an arrow pointing from Shen to the location of his Spirit Blade even if it is not visible. Twilight Assault will grant the shield if the Spirit Blade reaches Shen. If it is stopped, no shield is granted. It will grant the cooldown reduction upon hitting an enemy champion. Spirit's Refuge will grant the shield and/or the cooldown reduction after the protective zone disappears. Shadow Dash will grant the shield when the dash ends. It will grant the cooldown reduction upon hitting an enemy champion. If the dash is interrupted, the shield will instead be received the moment the crowd control source is applied, before damage calculation (if any). Stand United will give the shield and/or the cooldown reduction upon completing the channel.

---

* **Twilight Assault**
* **Twilight Assault**
* **COST:** 140 / 130 / 120 / 110 / 100 energy
* **COOLDOWN:** 8 / 7.25 / 6.5 / 6 / 5.5 seconds
* **CAST TIME:** none
* **EFFECT RADIUS:** Global
* **WIDTH:** 160
* **SPEED:** 2000 - 5000
* **Active:** Shen recalls his Spirit Blade to his location. Enemy champions hit are slowed for the next 2 seconds while moving away from Shen. Once it arrives, Shen empowers his next 3 basic attacks within 8 seconds to gain 75 bonus range and deal bonus magic damage.

---

* **Details**
* **Info**
* **Targeting input:** Auto
* **Damage type:** Type: Spell damage, Sub-type: Magic
* **Counters:** Spell shield, Parries, Projectile, Blocked
* **The Spirit Blade will stop in place upon colliding with Wind Wall or Unbreakable. If this occurs, Shen will not receive the empowered attacks. When it is called, the Spirit Blade also checks for units which's gameplay radius it overlaps (equal to a 0 radius check) before flying off, allowing it to hit enemies whose center is behind the missile origin. The empowered attack will not trigger against structures nor wards.**

---

* **Spirit's Refuge**
* **Spirit's Refuge**
* **COST:** 40 energy
* **COOLDOWN:** 18 / 16.5 / 15 / 13.5 / 12 seconds
* **CAST TIME:** none
* **EFFECT RADIUS:** 350
* **Active:** Shen primes his Spirit Blade, creating an area around it. After 2 seconds, or when Shen or an allied champion enters the area, the Spirit Blade generates a protective zone for 1.75 seconds, blocking all non-turret basic attacks that hit Shen or allied champions in the area. Spirit's Refuge cannot be ranked up at Level 1. Spirit's Refuge will also block damage from all abilities that use basic damage (Lunge, Mystic Shot, Steel Tempest).

---

* **Shadow Dash**
* **Shadow Dash**
* **COST:** 150 energy
* **COOLDOWN:** 18 / 16 / 14 / 12 / 10 seconds
* **CAST TIME:** none
* **TARGET RANGE:** 600 / 300
* **COLLISION RADIUS:** 50 / 60
* **SPEED:** 800 + 100% movement speed
* **Passive:** Dealing damage with Twilight Assault or Shadow Dash restores 30 / 40 / 50 (based on level) energy.
* **Active:** Shen dashes to the target location, dealing physical damage to enemy champions and monsters he passes through and taunting them for 1.5 seconds. Physical Damage: 60 / 85 / 110 / 135 / 160 (+ 15% bonus health). Twilight Assault and Spirit's Refuge can be cast during the dash. Shadow Dash will cast at max range if cast beyond that.

---

* **Details**
* **Info**
* **Targeting input:** Location
* **Damage type:** Type: Area damage, Sub-type: Physical
* **Counters:** Spell shield, Grounded, Knockdown, Blocked, Disrupted, Interrupted, Casting, Flash during Shadow Dash, Heal, Ignite, Smite, Flash, Teleport, Recall, Hexflash, Mark, Dash, Interrupted by death, Grounding effects, Immunizing effects, Cast-inhibiting effects, Champion skins
* **Casting Flash during Shadow Dash will end the dash prematurely, but the end-of-dash collision check will hit enemies at the blink's location still. This still cannot affect the same enemy more than once. The energy restore from Shadow Dash may only occur once.

---

* **Stand United**
* **Stand United**
* **COOLDOWN:** 200 / 180 / 160 seconds
* **CAST TIME:** none
* **TARGET RANGE:** Global
* **Active:** Shen focuses his will, channeling for 3 seconds and granting the target allied champion a shield for 5 seconds at the time of cast, increased by 0% − 60% (based on target's missing health). Minimum Shield Strength: 130 / 290 / 450 (+ 135% AP) (+ 16% bonus health). Maximum Shield Strength: 208 / 464 / 720 (+ 216% AP) (+ 25.6% bonus health). Upon completing the channel, Shen and his Spirit Blade blink to the target ally's location, placed between them and the nearest enemy champion. Shen also destroys any projectiles targeting him at the time of completion.

---

* **Details**
* **Info**
* **Targeting input:** Unit, Target out-of-range override, Walk in range of the target
* **Counters:** Grounded, Disruption, Disabled, Interrupted
* **Due to several character stats needing to be recalculated each time a character spawns, casting Stand United immediately upon respawning will cause its cooldown to be unaffected by ability haste, and the shielding will not be increased by Shen's ability power, but will be increased by his bonus maximum health. (bug)**
* **Stand United can target allies via the mini map or on their portraits or by using the F2 - F5 keys (none of this can be done if Shen is affected by nearsight or his target is untargetable). Shen will turn to face towards his target ally at the start of the channel. If the target is stealthed, enemies could, in theory, use this to estimate their location. Shen will channel so long as his target is alive (even if the granted shield is broken). If his target dies, the channel is canceled and Stand United goes on full cooldown. Interrupting Stand United's channel will not remove the shield prematurely. The target's screen will glow purple to telegraph that Shen has targeted them with Stand United. It will change back when the channel ends. Shen finds the nearest visible enemy champion within 2000 range from the ally or the nearest invisible champion within 600 range to place himself 175 units from his ally towards that enemy. The following table refers for interactions while Shen is channeling:**

**Among the secretive, Ionian warriors known as the Kinkou, Shen serves as their leader, the Eye of Twilight. He longs to remain free from the confusion of emotion, prejudice, and ego, and walks the unseen path of dispassionate judgment between the spirit realm and the physical world. Tasked with enforcing the equilibrium between them, Shen wields blades of steel and arcane energy against any who would threaten it.**

**Trivia**

[ ]

Shen

is written 慎
shèn
[ʂə̃n˥˩] "caution" in Chinese localization.

Shen was the first champion to use energy as a resource for abilities.

Before the release of Pulsefire Shen, neither him nor Zed reveal their faces in any of their skins, unlike Akali (All-star, Nurse, Blood Moon) and Kennen (Karate, M.D.). However, Shen has never revealed his full face in any skin.

Shen's dance references Tai chi 24-form.

A side-by-side comparison can be seen here.

Shen is the first dark-themed Ionian champion, before Varus, Syndra, Zed, Jhin, Xayah, & Kayn (Noxian-born).

Shen, Pantheon, and Twisted Fate were the first to have a global-range teleport ability.

After the other two's were heavily changed, Shen remained the only one left with such an ability until Rek'Sai was released.

Rek'Sai would then later lose her global-range teleport capabilities as well.

Shen used to gain the 'Law of Inverse Ninja Strength' cosmetic Easter egg debuff ( "This unit is a flippin' ninja!" - "This unit is weakened by the presence of other ninjas on its team!" ) when he, Akali, Akali, and/or Zed found themselves on the same team. It was removed in V3.14 for unknown reasons.
