        **Abilities**
          * Determination
            * Innate: Xin Zhao's basic attacks and Wind Becomes Lightning strikes generate a stack of Determination, stacking up to 3 times. The third stack consumes them all to deal 15 / 30 / 45 / 60% (based on level) AD bonus physical damage and heal Xin Zhao for 3 / 3.5 / 4% (based on level) of his maximum health (+ 65% AP).
            * Hide: Details, Info
              * Targeting input: Passive
              * Damage type: Type: Physical, Sub-type: Proc damage
              * Procs: Parries, Missing
              * The stack counter displays 1-3 rather than the usual 0-2, meaning that a count of 1 does not translate to having 1 stack.
              * Wind Becomes Lightning's generates one stack per strike that hits at least one enemy.
              * Stacks reset when Xin Zhao dies.
              * Stacks of Determination will be gained even if the attack is blocked.
              * PENDING FOR TEST: Determination's interaction with parrying effects (dodge, blind).
              * Determination deals proc damage.
              * Since it is a separate instance of damage when applied by basic attack or either of Wind Becomes Lightning's strikes, flat damage reduction that applies to both the main and bonus damage such as Amumu's Tantrum's passive will reduce each, for twice the reduction.
              * The bonus damage cannot critically strike.
              * When applied by a basic attack: The attack uses a unique animation. The bonus damage benefits from life steal.
              * PENDING FOR TEST: It applies life steal specifically.
              * When applied by either of Wind Becomes Lightning's strikes: Triggers against the closest target struck by the strike (equals first target to receive spell effects). Does not benefit from life steal, including not healing from Wind Becomes Lightning's 33% conversion for this bonus damage. Since proc damage is 'single target', Vamp will heal from 100% of the bonus damage.
          * Three Talon Strike
            * Cost: 30 Mana
            * Cooldown: 7 / 6.5 / 6 / 5.5 / 5
            * Cast time: none
            * Active: Xin Zhao empowers his next three basic attacks within 5 seconds to each have an uncancellable windup, deal bonus physical damage, and reduce his other abilities' current cooldowns by 1 second. Each attack refreshes the duration.
            * Bonus Physical Damage: 16 / 25 / 34 / 43 / 52 (+ 40% bonus AD)
            * Total Bonus Physical Damage: 48 / 75 / 102 / 129 / 156 (+ 120% bonus AD)
            * The third attack knocks up the target for 0.75 seconds.
            * Three Talon Strike's bonus damage is affected by critical strike modifiers.

            * Cost: 60 / 55 / 50 / 45 / 40 Mana

            * Speed: 6250
            * Active: Xin Zhao slashes in an arc and, after the cast time, thrusts his spear in a line in the target direction. Each strike deals physical damage to enemies hit, modified to 50% - 100% (based on level) against minions. The thrust deals increased damage, further by 0% - 33.3% (based on critical strike chance), and slows enemies hit by 50% for 1.5 seconds. Enemy champions and monsters hit are also marked Challenged for 3 seconds, during which they are revealed. Slash Physical Damage: 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 (+ 30% AD), Thrust Physical Damage: 50 / 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 (+ 90% AD) (+ 65% AP), Total Physical Damage: 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+ 120% AD) (+ 65% AP)

            * Passive - Challenge: The last enemy champion hit by Xin Zhao's basic attacks or Audacious Charge is marked Challenged for 3 seconds.
            * Active: Xin Zhao dashes to the target enemy's location, dealing magic damage to enemies near them and slowing them by 30% for 0.5 seconds. Audacious Charge's range is increased against Challenged targets. Xin Zhao then gains bonus attack speed for 5 seconds. Three Talon Strike and Crescent Guard can be cast during the dash.

This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the stun.
          * Tips & Tricks: Enemies will not be marked as Challenged if Crescent Guard has not been learned.

Xin Zhao is a resolute warrior loyal to the ruling Lightshield dynasty. Once condemned to the fighting pits of Noxus, he survived countless gladiatorial bouts, but after being freed by Demacian forces, he swore his life and allegiance to these brave liberators. Armed with his favored three-talon spear, Xin Zhao now fights for his adopted kingdom, audaciously challenging any foe, no matter the odds.

An expert at jungle warfare, Xin Zhao can harpoon a fruit from the rainforest canopy at a hundred yards. He just chooses not to, because it gets fruit chunks all over his spear.

A member of the vaunted winged hussars, Xin Zhao is one of the last standard bearers of a military order tracing its roots back to the late 17th century. Of course, his progenitors didn't ride an army of armored black pegasi into battle, but you know how it is.

Trivia
[ ]
Xin Zhao is voiced by Richard Epcar.
Xin Zhao was released when Season One started.
Xin Zhao's dance references Seung Mi-na's dance from Soulcalibur II.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen here.
During development, he was called XenZiou or XenZhao.
Xin Zhao is rendered, in Chinese localization, as Zhào Xìn [ʈ͡ʂau̯˥˩ ɕin˥˩], coincidentally the name of a Xiongnu general who temporarily defected to Han Chinese forces, though historical inspiration for Xin Zhao is evidently another Chinese general, Zhao Yun.
信 xìn means 'to believe, to trust' [Old Chinese *sins < *winʔ (cf. Sino-Tibetan root *yum [2] > 允 yǔn [ɥyn˨˩˦] "to be proper, to consent") ].
As a gladiator, Xin Zhao took the name of the fishing boat Viscero < Latin viscus 'entrails', where he once worked on.
