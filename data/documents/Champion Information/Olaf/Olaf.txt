        **Abilities**
        - **Berserker Rage**
          * Innate: Olaf gains bonus attack speed and life steal based on his missing health. At 70% missing health, he gains a maximum of 40% - 100% (based on level) bonus attack speed and 10% - 30% (based on level) life steal.

        - **Undertow**
          * Cost: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 Mana
          * Cooldown: 9 sec.
          * Cast Time: 0.25 sec.
          * Target Range: 425 / 1000
          * Effect Radius: 100 / 250 / 300
          * Width: 180
          * Speed: 1600
          * Active: Olaf throws an axe to the target location that deals physical damage to enemies it passes through and slows them for 1.5 - 2.5 (based on distance traveled) seconds. Enemy champions hit are also inflicted with 20% armor reduction for 4 seconds. Physical Damage: 65 / 115 / 165 / 215 / 265 (+100% bonus AD). Slow: 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45%. The axe remains in place for a duration equal to Undertow's cooldown, briefly granting sight of its surroundings. Olaf can pick up the axe to reduce Undertow's current cooldown to 2.5 sec. if it is not already below that amount. Undertow will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Nearby monsters are granted ghosting upon Undertow's cast.

        - **Tough It Out**
          * Cost: 30 Mana
          * Cooldown: 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 sec.
          * Cast Time: None
          * Active: Olaf gains bonus attack speed for 4 seconds. Bonus Attack Speed: 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80%. He also grants himself a shield for 2.5 seconds with an amount that is capped at 70% missing health. Shield Strength: 10 / 40 / 70 / 100 / 130 (+17.5% missing health). Tough It Out resets Olaf's basic attack timer.

        - **Reckless Swing**
          * Cost: 21 / 34.5 / 48 / 61.5 / 75 (+15% AD)

          * Cast Time: 0.25 sec.
          * Target Range: 325
          * Active: Olaf strikes thunder onto the target enemy, dealing true damage. True Damage: 70 / 115 / 160 / 205 / 250 (+50% AD). If Reckless Swing kills the target, Olaf heals himself equal to the health cost. Basic attacks reduce Reckless Swing's cooldown by 1 second.

        - **Ragnarok**
          * Passive: Olaf gains bonus armor and bonus magic resistance. Bonus Resistances: 10 / 20 / 30.

Bonus Attack Damage: 10 / 20 / 30 (+25% AD). Bonus Movement Speed: 20 / 45 / 70%. Ragnarok's duration is increased by and up to 2.5 seconds for each basic attack on-hit or Reckless Swing cast against an enemy champion.

        - Olaf's dance references Technoviking.
        - Ragnarok is named after the eponymous events from Norse mythology.
        - The crowd control removal references the Poetic Edda.
        - During development, he was simply called Enrage Barbarian.
        - Olaf's name derives from Old West Norse Óláfʀ, meaning 'bear-sark'.
        - Olaf's title means 'bear-sark', referring to the garment worn by Norse berserkers.
        - Since his lore-retconning, Olaf fears his prophesied death in peace & obscurity and instead longs for an unforgettable, glorious death in combat, inspired by the common Indo-European literary motif 'Imperishable Glory'.
        - Likewise, Pantheon challenges his opponent(s) into an epic battle.
        - In the V1.0.0.115 April Fools' Day patch, he was jokingly listed to receive a skin called 'Urlaf', referencing Urf.
