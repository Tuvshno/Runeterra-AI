* **Daredevil Impulse**

**Daredevil Impulse**

**TARGET IMMUNITY:** 10
**TARGET RANGE:** 650 / 727.5
**5** / 805 / 882.5
**5** / 960 (based on level)

**Innate:** Samira's damaging basic attacks and abilities against at least one enemy champion different from the previous damaging hit made against champions generate a stack of Style for 6 seconds, refreshing on subsequent hits and stacking up to 6 times.

**Style:** For each stack, Samira gains 2 / 2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 4% (based on level) bonus movement speed, up to a maximum of 12 / 15 / 18 / 21% (based on level). At maximum stacks, Samira can cast Inferno Trigger.

**Innate:** Samira's basic attacks against targets in 200 range use her blade, becoming non-projectile. Blade attacks post-hit, Blade Whirl, and the slash and explosives of Flair deal 2 − 19 (based on level) (+ 3.5% − 10.5% (based on level) AD) bonus magic damage, increased by 0% − 100% (based on target's missing health).

Samira's basic attack against an immobilized target is empowered to have an uncancellable windup and deal the attack's damage over 6 strikes in 0.5 seconds. If the target is a monster or is airborne, the attack also knocks them up for 0.5 seconds.

Samira will dash into her attack range of the target if they are nearby, though not through terrain. The empowered attack resets Samira's basic attack timer, is affected by critical strike modifiers, applies on-hit effects only once, and cannot occur on the same target more than once every few seconds.

**Hide Details**

**Info**
**Targeting input:** Passive
**Damage type:** Type: Physical, Sub-type: See Notes
**Magic:** See Notes
**Counters:** Spell shield, Parries, Projectile, See Notes, Grounded, Knockdown, Interrupted

The stack count is represented by the grades to the left of her health bar for Samira herself, and a stack counter underneath the bar that is visible to all players.

The empowered attack can trigger on immobilizes from both ally and enemy sources. Those applied by the neutral team (e.g., Dragon's initial knock back) can be targeted. It cannot trigger against enemies knocked airborne by a Blast Cone triggered by anyone.

(bug)
The empowered attack's interaction with immunities to crowd control: It will not trigger against crowd control immune and displacement immune targets. The knock up will be resisted by Riposte, but the ability does not trigger its on-immobilization effect. (bug)
The empowered attack will not apply the knock up against suspended enemies. The empowered attack will only apply the knock up if the target is still immobilized or airborne upon being hit. It will not apply if they are no longer disabled when hit. The empowered attack cannot be used against a target with a spell shield.

The application of the knock up can occur on any of the missiles of the empowered attack if it had not already occurred on the first missile. A missile that is parried by Riposte or is dodged, blocked, or missed while Samira is blinded cannot apply the knock up.

While grounded or rooted, Samira cannot dash into range to use the empowered attack. She can only use it if her target is within her attack range while under this condition. The on-target cooldown will apply even if the empowered attack is parried. The empowered attack rolls critical strike for each shot of the flurry.

The bonus magic damage dealt with the blade is default damage. The empowered attack is first one instance of basic damage and then five instances of default damage. The attacks do not deal the bonus damage against structures. The empowered attack is unaffected by attack speed modifiers.

Guinsoo's Rageblade's Phantom Hit and Runaan's Hurricane's bolts will not apply the bonus magic damage, since it is a hit effect of specifically the melee attack casts. Attacks with the gun and blade do not count as different attacks for stacking Style. Basic attacks using the blade are still classified as ranged. The melee attack's range condition is unaffected by attack range modifiers. Blade range is calculated edge-to-edge just like basic attack ranges are, hence both Samira gaining bonus size or her target increases the total distance at which Samira can attack them with the blade.

Since the knock up requires an exterior source to immobilize the enemy, Aftershock will be swapped with Grasp of the Undying for Samira at the start of the game. Since Inferno Trigger's cooldown is static, Ultimate Hunter will be swapped with Treasure Hunter for Samira at the start of the game. Abilities blocked by spell shields will still grant Samira Style stacks. Samira still gains Style stacks from damaging attacks and abilities landed against clones.

**Edit**
**Flair**

**Flair**

**COST:** 30 Mana
**COOLDOWN:** 6 / 5 / 4 / 3 / 2
**CAST TIME:** 0.25
**TARGET RANGE:** 340
**RANGE:** 950 / 890
**WIDTH:** 120 / 130
**SPEED:** 2600

**Active:** Samira fires a shot in the target direction that deals physical damage to the first enemy hit.

**Physical Damage:** 0 / 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 (+ 85 / 95 / 105 / 115 / 125% AD)

If a targetable enemy is in front of Samira at the time of cast, she will instead slash with her blade in a cone, dealing the same damage to enemies hit.

If Flair is cast during Wild Rush, Samira deploys explosives in her wake that detonate upon the end of the dash, dealing the same damage to enemies hit.

Flair can critically strike for (25% + 50%) bonus physical damage and will apply life steal at 66.6% effectiveness.

(bug)
Flair can be cast during Wild Rush even if Blade Whirl or Inferno Trigger are active.

The slash and explosives roll their critical strike against each target individually. The shot and the slash do not count as different abilities for stacking Style.

Samira's next attack after using Flair will occasionally come out faster.

(bug)
Samira can use Wild Rush during Flair's cast time.

This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Flair will fire or slash from wherever Samira is at the end of the cast time. Samira will always slash in her facing direction, and she will turn to face the target direction only once at the start of the cast time.

Flair can be buffered 0.5 seconds before it comes off cooldown. Only the shot will be destroyed by projectile-intercepting effects. The explosive placement is illustrated in Wild Rush regardless of whether Flair is available. The VFX always covers the the full dash's distance even if Wild Rush is interrupted mid-dash.

**Edit**
**Blade Whirl**

**Blade Whirl**

**COST:** 60 Mana
**COOLDOWN:** 30 / 28 / 26 / 24 / 22
**CAST TIME:** None
**EFFECT RADIUS:** 325

**Active:** Samira spins her blade over 0.75 seconds, destroying all hostile non-turret projectiles within the area for the duration. Samira slashes twice during Blade Whirl, each one dealing physical damage to all nearby enemies. The first slash occurs immediately and the second one occurs after the duration.

**Physical Damage:** 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80 (+ 80% bonus AD)
**Total Physical Damage:** 40 / 70 / 100 / 130 / 160 (+ 160% bonus AD)

Samira cannot attack nor cast Flair during Blade Whirl. Casting Inferno Trigger will end Blade Whirl early.

**Hide Details**

**Tips & Tricks**

**Info**
**Targeting input:** Auto
**Damage type:** Type: Physical, Sub-type: Area damage
**Counters:** Spell shield, Projectile, Blocked, Spell shield, Grounded, Knockdown, Interrupted

Samira gains the attack speed buff at the start of the dash, and it lasts for 3 seconds from that point on. Wild Rush does not deal its damage to turrets. Wild Rush prioritizes targeting champions over turrets. Wild Rush can be buffered 0.5 seconds before it comes off cooldown.

Inferno Trigger will be buffered to cast at the end of the dash if Flair was cast during the dash. Casting Flash during Wild Rush will interrupt the dash but deal damage to nearby enemies at the location. If Flair was cast during this time, an explosive will also be placed at that location. Wild Rush will also reset if Samira kills or gets assist credit on a clone that dies (to hostiles). (bug)

**Tips & Tricks**

Flair cannot be directly cast during this ability, but can still occur through the Wild Rush + Flair interaction.

**Edit**
**Wild Rush**

**Wild Rush**

**COST:** 40 Mana
**COOLDOWN:** 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 / 12
**CAST TIME:** None
**TARGET RANGE:** 600
**RANGE:** 650 / 800 / -150
**WIDTH:** 300
**SPEED:** 1600

**Active:** Samira dashes a fixed distance in the direction of the target enemy or enemy structure, dealing magic damage to enemies she passes through. She also gains bonus attack speed for 3 seconds.

**Magic Damage:** 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 (+ 20% bonus AD)
**Bonus Attack Speed:** 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40%

Scoring a takedown against an enemy champion within 3 seconds of damaging them resets Wild Rush's cooldown. Flair and Inferno Trigger can be cast during the dash. Casting Blade Whirl will buffer it to cast at the end of the dash.

**Hide Details**

**Info**
**Targeting input:** Unit, Target out-of-range override, Walk in range of the target
**Damage type:** Type: Magic, Sub-type: Drawn
**Counters:** Spell shield, Projectile, Blocked, Disruption, Grounded, Knockdown, Interrupted

Samira gains the attack speed buff at the start of the dash, and it lasts for 3 seconds from that point on. Wild Rush does not deal its damage to turrets. Wild Rush prioritizes targeting champions over turrets. Wild Rush can be buffered 0.5 seconds before it comes off cooldown. Inferno Trigger will be buffered to cast at the end of the dash if Flair was cast during the dash. Casting Flash during Wild Rush will interrupt the dash but deal damage to nearby enemies at the location. If Flair was cast during this time, an explosive will also be placed at that location. Wild Rush will also reset if Samira kills or gets assist credit on a clone that dies (to hostiles). (bug)

**Edit**
**Inferno Trigger**

**Inferno Trigger**

**COST:** 6 Style
**CAST TIME:** None
**STATIC COOLDOWN:** 5
**EFFECT RADIUS:** 600

**Active:** Samira unleashes a torrent of shots for 2.277 seconds, reducing her movement speed by 30%, and rapidly shooting at nearby enemies over 2.013 seconds at sporadic times in 0.2-second intervals each, dealing physical damage with each shot, reduced by 75% against minions.

**Physical Damage Per Shot:** 5 / 15 / 25
**Total Physical Damage:** 50 / 150 / 250
**Minion Damage Per Shot:** 1.25 / 3.75 / 6.25
**Total Minion Damage:** 12.5 / 37.5 / 62.5
**Each shot can critically strike for (75% + 50%) bonus physical damage and applies life steal at 50% effectiveness.**

A nearby visible enemy is required to cast this ability, and targets do not have to be visible to be shot at. Style stacks are consumed at the end of the effect. Samira cannot attack nor cast Flair and Blade Whirl during Inferno Trigger, but she can still move. Inferno Trigger will end prematurely by all forms of cast-inhibiting crowd control as well as disarm.

* **RANGE:** 950 / 890

* **SPEED:** 1400

**Samira's taunt prevents her from inputting attack commands and casting non-movement abilities, and she may only interrupt it herself with a movement command. After 3 seconds without interruption, she will toss a coin in the direction she is facing.**

**If she has at least 1, the coin deals 1 true damage to the first enemy champion hit, triggering Daredevil Impulse but granting them 1 of Samira's gold. If cast within 1200 units of a visible enemy champion, Samira will turn to face towards the closest one to perform the animation. Samira's Taunt can target and hit dead enemy champions, granting them 1 but not triggering other effects.**

**Hide Details**

**Info**
**Targeting input:** Auto, Damage type: Type: Spell damage, Sub-type: True

**Samira must have at least 1 to weaponize her Taunt animation.**

**Using her Taunt does not count as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive.**

**Flash and Wild Rush can be cast during her Taunt, but neither interrupts the effect.**

(bug)
If Samira's facing direction is changed before the coin is fired (e.g., by casting Wild Rush), she will still turn toward her initial facing direction to toss the coin. Note: facing direction, not toward the location of the target.

The poster was straightforward enough: “WANTED: Tahm Kench - Devil, DEAD OR ALIVE”, followed by a generous sum. Only the Mechanical Devil's got that kinda cash to pay.

* AD ratio per shot reduced to 60% AD from 70% AD.

**V10.19**

* Added Daredevil Impulse (Innate)
* Innate - Style:
	+ Damaging basic attacks and abilities against at least one enemy champion different from the previous damaging hit made against them grant Samira a Style stack for 6 seconds, refreshing on damaging attacks and abilities against enemy champions. The stack count is represented by the grades to the left of her health bar for Samira herself, and a stack counter underneath the bar that is visible to all units.
	+ Samira gains 0% − 21% (based on Style grade) bonus movement speed.
* Innate:
	+ Samira's basic attacks against targets in 200 range use her blade, becoming non-projectile. Basic attacks on-hit within this range and Blade Whirl, and the slash and explosives of Flair deal 2 − 19 (based on level) (+ 10% AD) bonus magic damage, increased by 0% − 100% (based on target's missing health).
	+ Additionally, Samira's basic attacks against immobilized enemies deal the attack's damage over 6 rapid attacks and knock up the target for 0.5 seconds. This causes her basic attack timer to reset and the attack to become uncancellable. If the target is not within attack range, Samira will dash into it from up to 800 / 850 / 900 / 950 / 1000 (based on level) units and then attack. This effect cannot occur on the same target more than once every 10 seconds.
	+ The empowered attack can critically strike.
	+ On-hit effects are only applied once.
* Flair (Q)
	+ Active: Samira fires a shot in the target direction, dealing 0 / 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 (+ 100% AD) physical damage to the first enemy it hits.
	+ If a targetable enemy is in front of Samira, she will slash with her blade instead, dealing the same damage to all enemies hit in a cone.
	+ Casting Flair during Wild Rush will cause Samira to deploy explosives along her path which detonate upon the end of the dash, dealing the same damage to enemies within the covered distance. This can be done while performing Blade Whirl and Inferno Trigger.
	+ Both the shot and slash can critically strike for (25% + 25%) bonus physical damage and apply life steal at full effectiveness.
* Mana Cost: 30.
* Cooldown: 6 / 5 / 4 / 3 / 2 seconds.
* Width: 120 / 130.
* Cast Time: 0.25 seconds.
* Speed: 2600.
* Blade Whirl (W)
	+ Active: Samira slashes around herself twice over 1.25 seconds, the first slash occurring immediately and the second being performed 0.25 seconds before the duration ends, each one dealing 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80 (+ 80% bonus AD) physical damage to nearby enemies.
	+ Samira destroys all hostile non-turret projectiles that enter or are in her vicinity during this time.

**Trivia**

[
]

* Samira, Elise, Gnar, Jayce, Kayle, and Nidalee are the only champions to be conditionally considered both ranged and melee.
* Samira was accidentally pushed to PBE prior to the supposed reveal.
* Samira is one of 20 champions without a single ability power ratio on any ability: Aatrox, Camille, Darius, Dr. Mundo, Draven, Garen, Kayn, Kled, Naafiri, Nilah, Olaf, Pyke, Riven, Sett, Talon, Urgot, Xayah, Yone, and Zed.
* Unlike conventional emotes, Samira's Taunt has mechanical functions. It creates a coin skillshot that, if Samira has 1 to spare, deals 1 damage and gives 1 to enemy champions.
* Samira comes from either Sanskrit Samīra समीर "wind, breeze, air" or Arabic Sāmira سميرة "night-companion, nighttalker", feminine active participle of سَمَرَ samara "to spend the night".
* Samira's movement animations change form depending on whether her recent attack used the gun or blade.
* The blocking animation of Blade Whirl has Samira explicitly shoot every single incoming projectile.
* Samira was teased in-game with the Style: Rank S loot item earnable in patch V10.17. It was awarded by scoring a takedown after fighting in a manner like Daredevil Impulse.
* If players look at the Daredevil Impulse stacks in the slot, it will show "Why are you looking? Go style on your enemies!"
