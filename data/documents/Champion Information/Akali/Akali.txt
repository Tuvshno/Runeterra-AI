[Assassin's Mark]
Effect radius: 500
Innate:

* When Akali damages an enemy champion with an ability, she creates a ring around them for 4 seconds, refreshing on subsequent damaging abilities against champions.

* When Akali exits the ring, for 2 seconds, she regains the bonus movement speed while facing nearby enemy champions and becomes empowered with Swinging Kama for 4 seconds.
* Swinging Kama:
	+ Akali's next basic attack is empowered to have its range doubled and deal 35 − 182 (based on level) (+ 60% bonus AD) (+ 55% AP) bonus magic damage.

Cooldown: 20 seconds
Cast time: 0.25 seconds
Target range: 250
Effect radius: 350 / 1175
Active:

* Akali restores 100 energy over 0.4 seconds and gains bonus movement speed that decays over 2 seconds.
* She also detonates a smoke bomb a fixed distance away in the target direction, creating a circular shroud that expands over the next 5 seconds into a ring.

* While the shroud is active, Akali's maximum energy is increased by 100.
* Bonus Movement Speed: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50%
* Entering the shroud renders Akali invisible, unless she is dashing.
* Declaring a basic attack or casting an ability will break the invisibility and prevent Akali from entering it for 1 - 0.625 (based on minutes) seconds, refreshing on subsequent attacks and casts.
* The marked section of Twilight Shroud will linger for the mark's duration, even after the shroud ends.

**Abandoning the Kinkou Order and her title of the Fist of Shadow, Akali now strikes alone, ready to be the deadly weapon her people need. Though she holds onto all she learned from her master Shen, she has pledged to defend Ionia from its enemies, one kill at a time. Akali may strike in silence, but her message will be heard loud and clear: fear the assassin with no master.**
