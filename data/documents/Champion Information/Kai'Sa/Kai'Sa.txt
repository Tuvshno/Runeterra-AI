### Abilities

#### Second Skin

- **Effect radius:** 2750
- Innate: Living Weapon
  - Kai'Sa can evolve each of her basic abilities by gaining a set amount of permanent stats from items and stat growth, granting them additional effects. Evolving an ability causes her to enter a 2-second cast time. The upgrade is lost if the stat requirement is no longer met.
- Innate: Plasma
  - Kai'Sa's basic attacks on-hit and Void Seeker apply stacks of Plasma to enemies for 4 seconds, refreshing on subsequent applications and stacking up to 5 times. Basic attacks each apply 1 stack and Void Seeker applies 2 stacks, increased to 3 if it is evolved. Her and nearby allies' immobilizing effects and polymorphs against enemy champions will also apply a stack of Plasma.
- Innate: Caustic Wounds
  - Plasma stacks applied by Kai'Sa's basic attacks or Void Seeker deal bonus magic damage. The fifth stack against a target consumes all Plasma stacks to deal additional bonus magic damage equal to 15% (+ 6% per 100 AP) of the target's missing health, capped at 400 against monsters.
