        **Champion lore**
        Amumu is a champion in League of Legends.
        
        **Lore**
        Legend claims that Amumu is a lonely and melancholy soul from ancient Shurima, roaming the world in search of a friend. Doomed by an ancient curse to remain alone forever, his touch is death, his affection ruin. Those who claim to have seen him describe a living cadaver, small in stature and wrapped in creeping bandages. Amumu has inspired myths, songs, and folklore told and retold for generations—such that it is impossible to separate truth from fiction.

He's been lonely in ages past, but no more: Lux is like his big sister, and Kindred is his… Kindred? Companionship hasn't stopped his occasional tantrums, of course, but at least now there's someone to shine his porcelain eyes after a nice cathartic cry.*
