      * **Petricite Burst**
        - Effect radius: 300
        - Passive: Whenever Sylas casts an ability, he generates a stack of Unshackled for 4 seconds, refreshing on subsequent casts and stacking up to 3 times. While Sylas has stacks, he gains 125% bonus attack speed.
        - Unshackled: Sylas' next basic attack is empowered to consume a stack to whirl his chains around him, dealing 130% AD (+ 25% AP) magic damage to the primary target and 40% AD (+ 20% AP) magic damage to nearby enemies. Damage to secondary targets executes minions that would be left below 25 health. Petricite Burst can critically strike for (75% + 50%) AD bonus magic damage to all targets hit.

After a 0.6-second delay, the chains' intersection explodes to deal magic damage to enemies within, reduced by 60% against minions and monsters. Magic Damage: 70 / 125 / 180 / 235 / 290 (+ 90% AP), Non-Champion Damage: 28 / 50 / 72 / 94 / 116 (+ 36% AP), Total Champion Damage: 110 / 185 / 260 / 335 / 410 (+ 130% AP), Total Non-Champion Damage: 68 / 110 / 152 / 194 / 236 (+ 76% AP).

      * **Abduct**
        - Cast time: 0.25
        - Range: 950 / 790
