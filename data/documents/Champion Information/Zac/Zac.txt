Innate - The Secret Weapon:

Zac

gains increased percentage

size

equal to

1.5%

of his

bonus

health

, capped at 35% increased size at 2333.3.

3.3

bonus

health

.

Zac's

size also reduces based on his

missing

health

, down to 70%

total

size while at 0% health

.

Innate - Goo:

Whenever

Zac

damages at least one enemy with an

ability

, he sheds a number of chunks of himself to a nearby location, landing towards nearby

visible

enemy

champions

and lasting for 6 seconds.

Stretching Strikes
: 1 chunk for each strike hit (excluding the collision) on different targets, up to 2

Unstable Matter
: 1 chunk if it hits at least one target

Elastic Slingshot
: 1 chunk for each enemy champion hit

Let's Bounce!
: 1 chunk for each bounce that hits an enemy champion, up to 4

Both

Zac

and enemy champions can interact with a chunk by being within 50 units of it: an enemy will destroy it, while

Zac

will consume it to

heal

for

5 / 6 / 7 / 8% (based on
Let's Bounce!'s Rank)

of his

maximum

health

.

Innate - Cell Division:

Periodically, upon taking fatal damage,

Zac

enters resurrection for 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4 (based on level) seconds and restores 50% of his

maximum

health

, splitting into 4 uncontrollable

Bloblets

. Each

bloblet

has

12%

of his

maximum

health

and moves towards

Zac's

location over the duration. Any damage the

bloblets

receive, excluding damage dealt in excess of their

total

health

, is also redirected to

Zac

in

true damage

. While in resurrection,

Zac

is

untargetable

and

unable to act

, and cannot take damage from sources other than the redirected damage from his

bloblets

.

After the duration,

Zac

is revived with 10 - 50%

maximum

health

.

Zac

will die once all bloblets are killed.

See

Pets

for more details about bloblets.

**Hide Details**

**Map-Specific Differences**

Info

Passive

The damage directed to

Zac

is

internal raw damage

.

The

bloblets

are

untargetable

while splitting, and will not split over terrain.

Zac's

increased size does not consider his base stats.

Cell Division's

chunks spawn in two versions:

Contestable:

They will fall to the ground at a point which is roughly equidistant from

Zac

and the nearest

visible

enemy champion within 1000 range of him (dropping slightly in

Zac's

favor). The location at which they fall to the ground is influenced by the direction in which

Zac

is currently facing. Cannot be interacted with for the first 0.25 seconds (except during

Let's Bounce!

).

Uncontestable:

They will fall to the ground near

Zac

and can be picked up immediately (version used by default).

Zac's

untargetability

upon triggering

Cell Division

does not

destroy

in-flight

projectiles

.

Chronoshift

and

Guardian Angel

will take priority over

Cell Division

.

Spirit Visage

and

Heal Power

increases the healing of both

chunks

and

bloblets

.

Ryze's

Realm Warp

is able to individually teleport

Zac

or his

bloblets

during

Cell Division

.

If

Zac

is transported to a new location before the

bloblets

landed, they will travel to form at his new position, adjusting their speed accordingly. If

Cell Division's

duration permits during this time,

Zac

will be revived even if the

bloblets

fail to recombine.

Cell Division's

bloblets

can be targeted by

Teleport

and

Syndra's

Force of Will

.

Other

bloblets

are not interrupted by the conditions above and will continue to recombine instinctively.

Zac's

health when the

bloblets

are sent out is set to what it would be if all

bloblets

recombined, and is actively updated when the

bloblets

take damage.

If

Zac's

health is higher than it is supposed to be when the

bloblets

converge on him, his health will be set to the correct value.

While the tether persists,

Zac's

next

basic attack

is replaced by a second

Stretching Strike

, empowering it to have a 0.25-second cast time and gain 25 bonus attack range. This attack cannot

critically strike

.

If the two

Stretching Strikes

affect different targets, both are

rooted

for 0.5 seconds and receive the same

slow

. After a 0.4-second delay,

Zac

displaces them toward each other over 300-units, though not through terrain.

If the two targets are

near

each other, they are instead slammed together through the displacement, dealing the initial

magic damage

and

knocking them up

and

stunning

them for 0.25 seconds upon impact. Surrounding enemies are also dealt the initial

magic damage

.

Both Stretching Strikes (the cast and the empowered attack)

reset

Zac's

basic attack timer.

Zac

is unable to move or attack while his left arm is in flight.

Zac is the product of a toxic spill that ran through a chemtech seam and pooled in an isolated cavern deep in Zaun’s Sump. Despite such humble origins, Zac has grown from primordial ooze into a thinking being who dwells in the city's pipes, occasionally emerging to help those who cannot help themselves or to rebuild the broken infrastructure of Zaun.

Never content with his extant creations, Viktor's latest innovation has forged an experimental alloy that shifts between liquid and solid states. Incredibly flexible yet nigh-indestructible, the new zoophagus assault constructs, or ZACs, spring onto the battlefield, harvesting and consuming any resistance that stands in their way.

The Foreglow affects everyone differently. For Zac, it burned away all of his insecurities, but opened up his senses to the loneliness felt by the other Zacs across the realms. They needed him, and now he has the power to bring everyone together as one. A family reunion for the ages.

- Rework

New Effect:

Active:

After a small delay, Zac bounces 4 times over 3 seconds, gaining 20% − 50% (based on duration) bonus movement speed as he does so but becoming unable to use basic attacks, Stretching Strikes, or Elastic Slingshot for the duration. There is a 1-second delay between each bounce.

Each bounce deals 140 / 210 / 280 (± 40% AP) magic damage to all nearby enemies, knocking them back for 1 second and subsequently slowing them by 20% for the same duration.

Enemies can be damaged by multiple bounces, with each beyond the first dealing 50% damage but not displacing them.

Effect Radius:

300 / 400.

Cooldown:

130 / 115 / 100 seconds.

Old Effect:

Active - First Cast:

Zac squishes himself down while charging for up to 2.5 seconds, during which he is unstoppable, and slowing by 30/40/50% any enemies standing on top of him.

Second Cast:

Zac knocks back nearby enemies 275 units over 1 second and deals 150/250/350 (± 90% AP) magic damage. If charged for at least 1 second before recasting, Zac instead scoops up enemies on top of him, carrying them towards the target location. While flying through the air, Zac is immune to crowd control.

Upon landing, nearby and transported enemies take the same magic damage and are slowed by 25% for 0.5 seconds.

Target Range:

700 / 850 / 1000.

Effect Radius:

300.

Cooldown:

130 / 115 / 100 seconds.

**Trivia**

[**]**

Zac stands for Zaun Amorphous Combatant.

Zac made a cameo in Battle Bunny Riven's artwork and maybe even in the game's Mac Version trailer (all before he was released).

Zac is the only champion that can be damaged by regular Smite (due to Cell Division's chunks being coded as minions) and to have 2 laugh animations.

Let's Bounce! references Tigger from Winnie-the-Pooh by A. A. Milne.

Zac is one of the six champions who use health as a resource for their abilities, the other five being Briar, Dr. Mundo, Olaf, Soraka, and Vladimir.
