**Abilities**

* **[ ]**
* **Spiked Shell**
	+ Innate: Rammus' basic attacks deal 10 (+10% armor) bonus magic damage on-hit, increased to 15 (+15% armor) during Defensive Ball Curl.
	+ Hide: Details, Info
	+ Targeting input: Passive
	+ Damage type: Type: Magic, Sub-type: Proc damage
	+ Counters: Parries, Blocked
	+ Spiked Shell applies to structures.

* **Powerball**
	+ COST: 60 Mana
	+ COOLDOWN: 16 / 13.5 / 11 / 8.5 / 6 seconds
	+ CAST TIME: none
	+ COLLISION RADIUS: 75
	+ EFFECT RADIUS: 250
	+ Active: Rammus channels for up to 6 seconds to roll into a ball, gaining 25% - 39.17% (based on level) bonus total movement speed per second over the duration, up to a maximum of 150% - 235% (based on level). Powerball can be recast after 1 second within the duration, and does so automatically afterwards or when interrupted. Rammus stops rolling upon colliding with an enemy, dealing magic damage to all nearby enemies and knocking them back 125 units, though not through terrain. Enemies hit are then stunned and revealed for 0.4 seconds, as well as slowed for 1 second.
	+ Magic Damage: 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 / 200 (+100% AP)
	+ Slow: 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80%
	+ Recast: Rammus ends Powerball.
	+ Hide: Details, Map-Specific Differences, Info
	+ Targeting input: Auto
	+ Damage type: Type: Magic, Sub-type: Area damage
	+ Counters: Spell shield, Grounded, Disruption, Not Disabled, Interrupted
	+ The initial cast and the manual recast count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive.
	+ The bonus movement speed stacks multiplicatively with other sources of movement speed boosts.
	+ Powerball will still collide with enemies if Rammus is ghosted.
	+ For the purpose of moving closer to an enemy when right clicking them, Powerball also reduces Rammus' attack range to 0 for the duration.
	+ Rammus will ignore unit collision for the purpose of pathfinding during Powerball.
	+ Rammus acts as if he were ghosted for the duration of Powerball.
	+ Powerball is not a movement channel, and so will not be interrupted by root and ground.
	+ Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the stun.
	+ The following table refers for interactions while Rammus is channeling: Type, Channel, Attacking, Disabled, Abilities, Defensive Ball Curl interrupts. Frenzying Taunt is disabled. Soaring Slam modifies this ability. This ability recasts to end channel.

* **Defensive Ball Curl**
	+ COST: 40 Mana
	+ COOLDOWN: 7 seconds
	+ CAST TIME: none
	+ Active: Rammus enters a defensive stance for 6 seconds, gaining bonus armor and bonus magic resistance. While active, enemies that use a basic attack on-hit against Rammus are dealt magic damage equal to Spiked Shell's bonus damage. Bonus Armor: 40 (+35 / 45 / 55 / 65 / 75% total armor), Bonus Magic Resistance: 10 (+30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% total magic resistance). Rammus' basic attacks extend the remaining duration of Defensive Ball Curl by 0.4 seconds, up to a maximum of 4 additional seconds. Defensive Ball Curl can be recast after 1 second within the duration, and does so automatically upon casting Powerball. Recast: Rammus ends Defensive Ball Curl.
	+ Hide: Details, Map-Specific Differences, Info
	+ Targeting input: Auto
	+ Damage type: Type: Magic, Sub-type: Non-damaging
	+ Counters: Spell shield, Not Blocked
	+ The initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. Deactivating the ability manually does not. Defensive Ball Curl ends immediately if Powerball is cast. Defensive Ball Curl will return damage from attacks and/or abilities that apply on-hit effects (Mystic Shot) as well as from Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury (will not return damage from turrets, H-28G Evolution Turret, or Jack in the Box). The resistance scaling will factor from all sources, including Defensive Ball Curl's flat bonus. This will recalculate over the duration.

			* Idolized by many, dismissed by some, mystifying to all, the curious being Rammus is an enigma. Protected by a spiked shell, he inspires increasingly disparate theories on his origin wherever he goes—from demigod, to sacred oracle, to a mere beast transformed by magic. Whatever the truth may be, Rammus keeps his own counsel and stops for no one as he roams the Shuriman desert.

			* Rammus roams the land in a pungent peel, and though he may look adorable, he gives new meaning to the phrase “silent but deadly.” Some say the effluvial enigma's armor reeks of sewage and sweaty socks, but strong-willed warriors know how sweet he can really be—if you can get past the smell.
