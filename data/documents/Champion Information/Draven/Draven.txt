* **Abilities:**
	+ **League of Draven:**
		- Passive: When Draven catches a Spinning Axe, kills a non-champion, or destroys a turret, he gains a stack of Adoration. Additionally, whenever Draven kills a minion or destroys a ward or trap, he generates a Strike stack for 10 seconds, refreshing on subsequent kills and stacking up to 6 times. All Strike stacks are lost if he drops an axe or a nearby minion dies without him killing it. The sixth stack consumes all stacks to grant him 2 Adoration stacks.
		- Map-Specific Differences: In Arena, Adoration stacks per kill or Axe catch changed to 5, Adoration stacks per Axe catch from an enemy Draven changed to 50, and New Effect: Gains 50 Adoration stacks per round.

		- Targeting input: Auto
		- Damage type: Physical
		- Counters: Parries, Projectile
		- Blocked: See notes
		- The landing location is determined by Draven's movement speed and direction at the time Spinning Axe hits the target. If Draven is actually moving, it will bounce directly into his path. Otherwise, it will bounce back towards his current location, either landing directly onto him or to his sides.
		- Spinning Axe will place a visual cue on the ground where it will land. This visual cue is visible to both teams, although Draven himself will see a more prominent marker.
		- Recasting Spinning Axe will refresh the buff and add another axe if possible.
		- There is no limit to how many axes can be juggled at once, just the limit of 2 of them at a time in Draven's hands.
		- Draven used to be able to catch (steal) an enemy Draven's axes. This event also prompted a few unique voice lines.
		- Spinning Axes may optically bypass Wind Wall and Blade Whirl but they will be destroyed upon collision.
		- Unbreakable will not prevent the axe from bouncing off when Braum is the target.
		- Unbreakable will not prevent the axe from bouncing off when Braum is not the target.
		- The axe will still bounce against parrying effects.
		- Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury does not interact with the effects of the axes.
		- If a Spinning Axe is readied during a basic attack wind-up, the effects will be applied to the fired attack.
		- Spinning Axe attacks deal their total increased damage in a single instance of basic damage.
		- The empowered attack will not trigger against structures.
		- The duration will refresh on-attack against them.
		- Spînning Axe has an indicator that appears on the ground for Draven to stand on. Some skins have a unique indicator.

		- Cast time: 0.5
		- Target range: Global

		- Speed: 2000
		- Active: Draven hurls two massive axes in the target direction that briefly grant sight of their surroundings and deal physical damage to enemies hit. Enemy champions that are damaged to or while below a health threshold equal to the number of Adoration stacks are executed.

		- Whirling Death can be recast after 1 second while the axes are traveling, and does so automatically after the axes hit an enemy champion or the edge of the map.
		- Recast: Draven forces the axes to reverse direction, slowly coming to a stop before homing back to him, dealing the same damage to enemies hit.
		- Whirling Death deals 100% − 40% (based on enemies hit) damage, resetting upon reversing direction.
		- Minimum Physical Damage: 70 / 110 / 150
