**Rage Gene**

**Innate - Rage Gene:**

Mini Gnar generates 4 / 7 / 11 (based on level) Rage over 2 seconds upon dealing or receiving damage. Against non-champions, basic attacks and Boomerang Throw instantly generate 0.5 / 0.875 / 1.375 (based on level) Rage. Against champions, Boomerang Throw instantly generates 1 / 1.75 / 2.75 (based on level) Rage, 25% of the amount, and basic attacks instantly generate 2 / 3.5 / 5 (based on level). Boomerang Throw can only generate Rage once per cast and grants Rage based on the first enemy hit. Gnar's Rage decays after being out of combat for 13 seconds. At maximum Rage, Gnar's abilities are switched to Mega Gnar's abilities for 4 seconds. Casting one of Mega Gnar's abilities will cause him to transform into Mega Gnar, else he will transform automatically after the 4 seconds have elapsed. Gnar's Mega form lasts for 15 seconds, with his Rage bar depleting as an indication of remaining time. Rage cannot be generated while in this form. Afterwards, Gnar returns to Mini Gnar, retaining his current percentage health and becoming too tired to generate Rage for 15 seconds. Gnar gains different stat bonuses based on whether he is in Mini or Mega form. Both of Gnar's forms share their ability cooldowns.

---

**Map-Specific Differences**

**Targeting input:** Passive

**Passive:** The Rage generated upon dealing or receiving damage occurs over 2 seconds with 4 ticks every 0.5 seconds. It also does not stack but instead refreshes with subsequent applications (of dealing or receiving damage). The bonus rage generation on basic attacks counts as an on-hit effect, and is triggered by Runaan's Hurricane and Guinsoo's Rageblade. In-game, the value on the Rage bar always displays rounded down to the nearest integer. Mega Gnar's gained health is not affected by healing modifiers such as Grievous Wounds and those from items and runes. When returning to Mini Gnar, Gnar will only retain his current health percentage, not current health total. This is intentional to prevent Gnar from simply triggering Rage Gene in order to heal himself over time. Gnar's abilities share cooldowns across forms. The final stats, after Rage Gene being applied, can be seen on Mini Gnar's and Mega Gnar's respective data template, in the front page. Mini Gnar gains 5.5% − 99% (based on level) bonus attack speed.

---

**Mini Gnar**

**Innate:**

Gnar gains bonus movement speed, bonus attack range, attack speed, and attack speed growth.

---

**Bonus Movespeed:** 0 − 20 (based on level)

**Total Movespeed:** 335 − 355 (based on level)

**Bonus Range:** 0 − 100 (based on level)

**Boomerang Throw**

**COOLDOWN:** 20 / 17.5 / 15 / 12.5 / 10

**CAST TIME:** 0.25

**RANGE:** 1125 / 3000

**WIDTH:** 110 / 150

**SPEED:** 2500 - 1400 / 60 - 2600

**Active:** Gnar throws a boomerang in a line in the target direction that deals physical damage to enemies in its path and slows them for 2 seconds. After reaching its maximum range or hitting an enemy, the boomerang flies back toward Gnar based on his current movement, dealing 50% damage to subsequent targets. Physical Damage: 5 / 45 / 85 / 125 / 165 (+ 115% AD). Reduced Damage: 2.5% of the amount. Slow: 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 / 35%. Catching the boomerang while it is returning back refunds 40% of the ability's total cooldown. Enemies can be hit only once per pass.

---

**Hyper**

**Passive:**

Gnar's basic attacks on-hit and ability hits apply a stack of Hyper to enemies for 3.5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent applications and stacking up to 3 times. The third stack against a target consumes them all to deal bonus magic damage, capped at 300 against monsters, and grant Gnar 20 / 40 / 60 / 80% (based on GNAR!'s rank) bonus movement speed that decays over 3 seconds.

---

**Bonus Magic Damage:** 0 / 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 (+ 6 / 8 / 10 / 12 / 14% of target's maximum health) (+ 100% AP).

---

**COOLDOWN:** 20 / 17.5 / 15 / 12.5 / 10

**CAST TIME:** 0.25

**TARGET RANGE:** 475

**EFFECT RADIUS:** 150

**Active:** Gnar leaps to the target location, then gains bonus attack speed for 6 seconds. Bonus Attack Speed: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60%. If Gnar lands on a unit he will bounce 500 units further in the same direction. Landing on an enemy deals them physical damage and slows them by 80% for 0.5 seconds. Physical Damage: 50 / 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 (+ 6% maximum health). Gnar will not bounce if he is immobilized, excluding from sleep (bug), during the first leap. Boomerang Throw can be cast during the dash. Hop will cast at max range if cast beyond that.

**Hyper**

**Passive:**

Gnar's basic attacks on-hit and ability hits apply a stack of Hyper to enemies for 3.5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent applications and stacking up to 3 times.

**The boomerang return direction is determined at the apex of its flight by Gnar's current position and which direction Gnar is heading at the time. Since the cooldown between the two is shared, Mini Gnar may pick up a boulder and/or Mega Gnar may catch a boomerang. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.**

---

**Hyper**

---

**Passive:**

Gnar's basic attacks on-hit and ability hits apply a stack of Hyper to enemies for 3.5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent applications and stacking up to 3 times. The third stack against a target consumes them all to deal bonus magic damage, capped at 300 against monsters, and grant Gnar 20 / 40 / 60 / 80% (based on GNAR!'s rank) bonus movement speed that decays over 3 seconds.

**Mega Gnar**

---

**Innate:**

Gnar gains the following increases to his base statistics: 100 − 831 (based on level) base health, 3.5 − 54.5 (based on level) base armor, 3.5 − 63 (based on level) base magic resistance, and 8 − 50.5 (based on level) base attack damage.

---

**Gnar's base stats including these bonuses are provided at the top of Gnar's gameplay article, and will appear separately as Mega Gnar on list articles. Gnar restores health equal to the amount gained when transforming into Mega Gnar, but will only retain his current percentage health when returning to Mini form. This is not affected by healing modifiers.**

**Boulder Toss**

---

**COOLDOWN:** 20 / 17.5 / 15 / 12.5 / 10

**CAST TIME:** 0.5

**RANGE:** 1150

**EFFECT RADIUS:** 250

**WIDTH:** 180

**SPEED:** 2100

**Active:** Gnar throws a boulder in the target direction that stops upon hitting an enemy, dealing physical damage to nearby enemies upon impact and slowing them for 2 seconds. The boulder then remains on the ground for 6 seconds. Physical Damage: 45 / 90 / 135 / 180 / 225 (+ 140% AD). Slow: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50%. After 0.3 seconds, Gnar can pick up the boulder by moving within 90 units of it, refunding 70% of the ability's total cooldown.

---

**Wallop**

---

**COOLDOWN:** 7

---

**CAST TIME:** 0.6

**RANGE:** 550

**WIDTH:** 200

**CAST TIME:** none

**TARGET RANGE:** 675

**EFFECT RADIUS:** 375

**INNER RADIUS:** 200

**Active:** Gnar leaps to the target location and deals physical damage to nearby enemies upon impact. After a 0.25-second delay, Gnar sends out a shockwave, dealing the same damage to additional enemies in a larger radius. Physical Damage: 80 / 115 / 150 / 185 / 220 (+ 6% maximum health). If Crunch is used to transform, Gnar will still be able to bounce as per Hop. The shockwave will occur where Gnar lands. Enemies Gnar lands directly on top of are affected by Hop's slow. Crunch will cast at max range if cast beyond that.

**COOLDOWN:** 90 / 60 / 30

---

**CAST TIME:** 0.25

**Gnar is an excitable yordle whose playful antics can erupt into a toddler’s outrage in an instant, transforming him into a massive beast bent on destruction. Frozen in True Ice for millennia, the curious creature broke free and now hops about a changed world he sees as exotic and wondrous. Delighted by danger, Gnar flings whatever he can at his enemies, be it his bonetooth boomerang… or an uprooted tree.**

What started as simple gifts of food blossomed into a loving friendship, only for Gnar to suddenly fall ill and pass. Because of their familial love, Gnar now returns as an Eidola Vida, ready to protect his family from danger.**

**Trivia**

---

**[**]**

**Gnar, Elise, Nidalee, Jayce, Kayle, and Samira are the only champions to be conditionally considered both** ranged **and** melee**.

**Gnar's concept is built on monstrous transformations in fiction coupled with the** Fish Out of Water **trope.**

**Inspirations include** Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde **by** Robert Louis Stevenson**,** Gremlins**, and** Hulk **by** Marvel Comics**.

**Paleontologically speaking, Gnar is not a missing link, i.e.** transitional specimen**, but he belongs to the Yordle population ancestral to modern ones; colloquially-speaking, he is the great-great-...-granduncle of all living Yordles.**

**In Brazilian localization, Gnar's title was changed to** O Yordle Pré-histórico **('the Prehistoric Yordle') in order to avoid matchmaking-rating-associated jokes/bullying derived from** O Elo Perdido **('the Missing Link').**

**Gnar is the second champion to have two champion portraits (** Mini Gnar** and** Mega Gnar**), the first being** Quinn **and** Valor**.

**He is also the third to have more than one chat name, the first being** Anivia** and** Eggnivia**, and the second being anyone polymorphed by** Lulu **(** Squill **).**

**As well as the seventh champion to have more than four abilities, the others being** Elise**,** Heimerdinger**,** Jayce**,** Karma**,** Nidalee**,** Lee Sin**,** Rek'Sai** and** Yorick**.

**Mini Gnar has the fewest active abilities of any ranged champion (** Hyper** and** GNAR!** are fully passive effects) and the lowest health at Level 18 (1645).**

**Mega Gnar has his own separate emotes from Mini Gnar's.**

**His dance references** Donkey Kong**.

**Boulder Toss' projectile is shaped like the** Riot Games Inc. **logo.**

**Mega Gnar has the highest** level 18 **base** attack damage (157).

**Although patch** V7.16 **made it so the portrait of the selected skin would be used in the central portion of the in-game UI, transforming into** Mega Gnar **always uses his base portrait for all skins.**

**Hop has the shortest ability name at 3 characters long.**

**For contrast** Life Form Disintegration Ray **is the longest ability name at 29 characters long, exceeding Hop by 26 characters.**
