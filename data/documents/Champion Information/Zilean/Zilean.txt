**Abilities**

* **Time in a Bottle**
  + *Innate: Zilean generates 2 / 3.5 / 5 / 12 (based on level) experience every 5 seconds. Time in a Bottle is on cooldown when the game starts and becomes disabled when Zilean reaches level 18.*
  + *Function: Zilean channels for 1.2 seconds after a 0.5-second cast time. The channel is interrupted and disabled upon entering combat with enemy champions or taking damage from turrets, placing it on a 10-second cooldown. A successful channel levels up the target and rewards Zilean the same amount of experience for himself as well.*
