If
Wither's
duration is affected by
Tenacity
the effects will apply slower (negative tenacity percentage) or faster (positive tenacity percentage) so the maximum values are still reached when the modified duration ends.

Wither's
cripple effectiveness calculates from its slow's base values, thus
slow resist
will not interact with the attack speed modifier indirectly.

Both
slow

cripple
from
Wither
are considered to be a single

Therefore,
slow immunity
will prevent both, even without technical

Nasus is an imposing, jackal-headed Ascended being from ancient Shurima, a heroic figure regarded as a demigod by the people of the desert. Fiercely intelligent, he was a guardian of knowledge and peerless strategist whose wisdom guided the ancient empire of Shurima to greatness for many centuries. After the fall of the empire, he went into self-imposed exile, becoming little more than a legend. Now that the ancient city of Shurima has risen once more, he has returned, determined to ensure it never falls again.

Trivia
[
]

Original Nasus

Nasus

literally means "nose" in Latin - referencing his
golden wolf
head's long nose.

During development he was simply called
Anubis Head
or '
Ammon
' "hidden, unseen".

[2]

He was voiced by Gene McDaniels.

In the now-removed official League of Legends
forums
, the
original icon
of
Fury of the Sands
was used to represent the "Player Concepts" and "Champion Feedback" sections.

Nasus, The Curator of the Sands

Following the death of his original voice actor, he is voiced by
Erik Todd Dellums
in both
League of Legends
and
Legends of Runeterra
.

Dellums also voices Nasus in
Shurima: Descent into the Tomb
and
Rise of the Ascended
.

Infernal Nasus

is voiced by the same voice actor.

Nasus

is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect:
Aurelion Sol
,
Bard
,
Bel'Veth
,
Cho'Gath
,
Draven
,
Kindred
,
Senna
,
Shyvana
,
Sion
,
Smolder
,
Swain
,
Sylas
,
Thresh
, and
Veigar
.

In Nasus' case,
Siphoning Strike
infinitely stacks the bonus
physical damage
of itself.

Nasus -
Renekton
is one of seven pairs of sibling champions (the others being
Cassiopeia
-
Katarina
,
Kayle
-
Morgana
,
Garen
-
Lux
,
Yasuo
-
Yone
,
Darius
-
Draven
, and
Vi
-
Jinx
).

Though not a pair,
Anivia
,
Ornn
, and
Volibear
are also siblings.

Nasus' Japanese voice actor is
Jouji Nakata
.

Nasus is one of a few champions to have multiple textures in one skin. When he uses
Fury of the Sands
.
Four other champions with this feature are
LeBlanc
(via
Mirror Image
),
Shaco's
(via
Hallucinate
),
Wukong
(via
Warrior Trickster
), and
Malphite
(via
Granite Shield
and
Thunderclap
).
