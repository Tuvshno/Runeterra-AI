**Abilities**

* **Guerrilla Warfare**
	+ Innate: Teemo gains invisibility after 1.5 seconds without moving, taking damage, performing actions that break stealth, channeling, or being in stasis.
	+ Innate - Element of Surprise: When Teemo breaks stealth, he gains 20/40/60/80% (based on level) bonus attack speed for 5 seconds.
	+ Hide Details: If Teemo triggers Element of Surprise twice in less than 3 seconds, he will only refresh the bonus attack speed's duration (it will not stack with itself). Charm, Flee, and Taunt will force him out of stealth. If Teemo is in a brush while stealthed, only Taunt will break it.
	+ Guerrilla Warfare's stealth is special-cased to be interrupted whenever Teemo moves from his location by any means (whether by dashing, blinking, being displaced, or simply moving), thus, performing actions that do not normally break stealth which also involve movement will cause the invisibility to break. Notably, Flash and Teleport. If Teemo is in a brush, the aforementioned spells do not end the stealth so long as his exact destination is still inside brush. Starting Teleport's channel will not break Guerrilla Warfare, only the blink upon completing the channel will (with the exception stated above). Guerrilla Warfare will not activate while Recalling.

	+ Blind Duration: 2 / 2.25 / 2.5 / 2.75 / 3 (doubled against minions and monsters)
	+ Increased Blind Duration: 4 / 4.25 / 4.5 / 4.75 / 5
	+ Map-Specific Differences: Arena differences - Base damage changed to 70 / 110 / 150 / 190 / 230, AP ratio changed to 70% AP, Blind duration changed to 1.5 / 1.75 / 2 / 2.25 / 2.5 seconds.

**Having abstained from pranking his “best friend forever” literally once, the Spirit of Salvation has gifted Teemo with his wildest dream—becoming shiny and gold. Never one to leave anybody alone, ever, he has promised his BFF to prank them at every opportunity, every day, until they die and join him in the spirit realm. Good luck to them.**
