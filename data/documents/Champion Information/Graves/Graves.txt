					- Target Range: 425
					- Range: 565
					- Width: 40
					- Angle: 24° / 30°
					- Speed: 3800 / 3000 / 3400
				+ **Innate** - Double Barrel
					- Graves' basic attacks consume ammunition within 2 shells.
					- He will reload over a few seconds immediately after expending all shells or withholding leftover shells for a while.
					- The reload time is reduced by Graves' level and bonus attack speed, and can be interrupted by declaring an attack or casting an ability.
				+ **Innate** - 12-Gauge
					- Graves' basic attack sprays 4 pellets in a cone, each colliding with the first enemy unit or structure in their path.
					- Each subsequent pellet hitting the same target deals about one-third of the damage of the first pellet.
					- Pellets deal 25% reduced damage against structures.
				+ **Critical strikes**
					- Spray 6 pellets over a 25% wider cone.
					- Each pellet deals (30% + 20%) bonus physical damage, resulting in 73.3% (+ 18.6%) bonus damage to attacks where all pellets hit.
					- 242.5% - 346.4% (+ 26.1% - 37.3% based on level) AD physical damage if all pellets hit.
					- Pellets apply life steal at 100% effectiveness. Only the first pellet to hit each enemy applies on-hit effects.
				+ **Innate** - Buckshot
					- Non-champion units hit by more than one pellet are knocked back, though not through terrain.

				+ **Details**
					- The in-game HUD displays Graves' reload speed in place of his attack speed. This is a visual bug, and his attack speed behaves normally.
					- His reload speed is in the form of reloads per second: Graves' bonus attack speed growth and the cap affect his reload speed, making his bonus attack speed more worth after each level.
					- Reload speed: Scales less the more attack speed you have until 150% bonus attack speed (not included growth). Going over that will decrease the reload speed until capping at 200% bonus attack speed.
					- The reload time after firing both shells and the time before the reloading starts while sitting on one shell are the same, of 2.08 seconds. They're then reduced by bonus attack speed, to a minimum of 1.54 - 1.12 seconds.
					- Reload speed at 150% bonus attack speed: 0.651 - 0.891.
					- The reload time with one shell is 1.3 seconds.
					- Graves' attack windup is based on such a low value that it will always take only 1 game tick, even at the lowest possible attack speed (0.2AS).
				+ **Effects of Rapid Firecannon**
					- When Graves' range is increased by 35% to 573.75 via Rapid Firecannon, it has special effects on his cone spread:
						* The reach of the individual missiles is also increased by 35% to 843.75 / 783.75.
						* The spread of the individual missiles is decreased by 35% (angle × 1/1.35) to 17.7° / 22.2°.
						* The reduced spread means that the empowered attack can deal adequate damage in a scaled-up cone.
						* Given the right circumstances, pellets can fly past and beyond the intended target without colliding with them, and thus collide with other enemies.
						* The first pellet to hit an enemy deals basic damage, additional ones to hit the same enemy from the same attack deal default damage.
						* Because of this, only the first pellet to hit each enemy applies on-hit effects.
						* Warden's Mail only reduces damage from the first pellet to hit its wearer.
						* Pending for test: Randuin's Omen's damage reduction to critical damage will apply to the damage of each pellet from a critical buckshot.
				+ **Attack effects**
					- On-hit effects are dealt to each stuck target, but not multiple times to the same target by subsequent pellets from the same attack.
					- The order is based on the order in which the targets are hit. Single-use on-hit effects (e.g., Spellblade) will be applied to the first enemy hit; the closest one.
					- On-action effects such as Help, Pix! and Runaan's Hurricane will be triggered, and still obey their standard target-acquisition rules.
					- Wind's Fury can select secondary targets that will also be damaged by collision from Graves' attack.
					- Energized is special and will be applied by a hidden homing attack missile (3000 missile speed, 3400 on crit), reminiscent of the more standard ranged attack of pre-rework Graves. The effect is therefore guaranteed to affect his attack target.
					- Black Cleaver triggers on every instance of physical damage, so it will apply 1 stack when each individual pellet hits, stacking multiple times if multiple pellets hit the same target (Armor reduction does not take effect until the automatic stat update).

					- COOLDOWN: 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 seconds
					- CAST TIME: None
					- TARGET RANGE: 375 / 275
					- Active: Graves dashes to the target location, reloading one shell while generating a stack of True Grit for 4 seconds, stacking up to 8 times. Dashing towards an enemy champion generates 2 stacks of True Grit.
					- Quickdraw's current cooldown is reduced by 0.5 seconds for every pellet impacting an enemy.
					- True Grit: For each stack, Graves gains bonus armor. Subsequent casts of Quickdraw and attacks versus non-minions will refresh the duration.
					- Bonus Armor: 2 / 5 / 8 / 11 / 14
					- Maximum Bonus Armor: 16 / 40 / 64 / 88 / 112
					- Quickdraw resets Graves' basic attack timer. If Graves dashes while reloading, he can cast any of his abilities during the dash.
					- (bug) Quickdraw will cast at max range if cast beyond that.

					- Malcolm Graves is a renowned mercenary, gambler, and thief—a wanted man in every city and empire he has visited. Even though he has an explosive temper, he possesses a strict sense of criminal honor, often enforced at the business end of his double-barreled shotgun Destiny. In recent years, he has reconciled a troubled partnership with Twisted Fate, and together they have prospered once more in the turmoil of Bilgewater’s criminal underbelly.

Following his discovery of something deep behind enemy lines, he received an offer to teach at the Academy from the God-Weapon itself. His hallmark cigar-munching, dispassionate teaching etiquette is a small price to pay for his decades of experience.
