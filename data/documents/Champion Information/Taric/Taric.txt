X. Trivia
[
]
- Taric comes from طارق Arabic Ṭariq "striker" < Semitic root ṭ-r-q "to strike".
[2]
Ṭariq later underwent semantic shift from "striker" to "One knocking at the door; wayfarer, traveller by night" and thus "star".
Surfer Singed carries a giant bottle of "Taric's Tropical Tan" sunscreen.
