**Prophet of an Elder God**

* **Innate**
* **Periodically**, Illaoi spawns a Tentacle on the nearest terrain perpendicular to her location, if no other Tentacles are already nearby it. Tentacles fully spawn after a 2 second delay and are untargetable in the meantime.
* **Tentacles are commanded to attack by Illaoi's abilities**, dealing 9 − 162 (based on level) (+ 100% AD) (+ 40% AP) physical damage to all enemies struck, increased by 0% − 30% (based on Tentacle Smash's rank).
* **Enemies struck by multiple slams within 0.5 seconds of another take 50% damage for the second and 25% damage for all other additional slams.**
* **Each Tentacle also heals Illaoi for 5% of her missing health if it hits at least one enemy champion.**
* **See Pets for more details about Tentacles.**

---

**Map-Specific Differences**

* Arena differences: heal health ratio changed to 3.5% missing health.

**Tips & Tricks**

* Spirits are classified as clones: Spirits can only be fully targeted by Illaoi's team and neutral monsters. The Spirit's allies cannot manually select it as a valid target for spells and abilities, but they can still do so with automatically targetted effects.
* Spirits take 50% damage from turrets.
* Spirits cannot be healed or shielded (Summon Aery excluded).
* The Spirit's destination is decided based on Illaoi's position and facing direction when the target is hit.
* The Spirit is untargetable while it is being pulled, and spawns with the tethered champion's default model and size.
* The Spirit's lifetime is sometimes 0.25 seconds longer, while its untargetability is sometimes shorter, causing Tentacles to hit an inconsistent amount of times.
* Redirected damage is calculated by taking the pre-mitigation damage against the Spirit, applying Test of Spirit's damage modifier, and then capping it to the Spirit's current health.
* Illaoi needs 937.5/875/812.5/750/687.5 total AD to reach 100% redirected damage. However, the damage is still dependent on the Spirit's and Vessel's damage modifiers and may not always be able to deal 100% of the target's current health as total redirected damage.
* Spell shields may only prevent the initial spirit grab and the slow upon becoming a Vessel, but they will not prevent becoming a Vessel or Tentacles from attacking.
* The tendril can be blocked by abilities such as Yasuo's Wind Wall, but the returning tether slow cannot, even if it can otherwise be destroyed.
* The tether slow will not be fired if the target is already untargetable when the Spirit dies.
* The spirit pull is not considered a crowd control effect and will not be blocked by crowd control immunity, except for Morgana's Black Shield.
* The projectile tentacle model is linked to Illaoi's model animation and size. However, gameplay wise it is not, thus the actual hitbox being different than the position, width and length of the visible model.
* The model will stop mid-air or vanish if Illaoi goes into stasis, sleep, or airborne, but the actual hitbox will continue its trajectory unseen.
* The projectile is visible to enemies if Illaoi is not visible.
* Illaoi spawns the Tentacle 700 range away from her, unless there's a natural wall blocking the way making the Tentacle spawn on it, with an angle relative to the direction she's facing.
* 1+ champions: one Tentacle at 0 degrees (towards Illaoi's facing direction), 2+ champions: one Tentacle at 60 degrees, 3+ champions: one Tentacle at 300 degrees, 4+ champions: one Tentacle at 120 degrees, 5+ champions: one Tentacle at 240 degrees, 6+ champions: one Tentacle at 180 degrees.
* Tentacles may spawn on base barriers. If Illaoi is in the center of a base barrier, all Tentacles will spawn in the same position and stack over each other, making it appear as if there was only one Tentacle.
* Illaoi's facing direction is decided by the position of the cursor on cast, but can also be changed mid-cast through other effects, such as Flash.
* If there are no walls nearby, spawning the last Tentacle will form a perfect hexagon.
* Spell shields will block the ability's damage but will not prevent Tentacles from spawning.
* If Illaoi dies within 0.25 seconds of dropping down, she will spawn buffed Tentacles, but she won't manage in time to buff the already spawned ones.
* If Illaoi is near a Tentacle that is about to spawn, it will spawn buffed by Leap of Faith even if Illaoi is no longer nearby.
* Using Harsh Lesson after Illaoi drops down will command Tentacles to instantly attack, regardless if they were already attacking. Their old attack will keep on going and will hit while the second attack is on its animation attack.
* This makes it possible for the same tentacle to reduce its own damage by having the second attack hit too fast, which is not otherwise possible.
* Using Harsh Lesson an instant before Leap of Faith's buff finishes will delay the Tentacle's attack.
* Pets [Tentacle] have a base attack speed of 1.00, but they will always have 1 attack speed when queuing up attacks, even if affected by Leap of Faith's buff.
* If a Tentacle is killed while attacking, the Tentacle will first finish its attack and then die, without being able to queue up other commands.
* Tentacles will only start attacks based on targets' center, but they will also hit targets whose edge is inside the area.
* Target type: Ward (can be teleported to).
* On-hit effects: Not mitigated by block or dodge.
* Spell effects: Applies spell effects as area damage.
* Protection: A single spell shield can block all tentacle attacks that hit at the same time.
* Abilities: Slam, Awakening, Enrage, Vision.
* Slam: The Tentacle damages all non-structure enemies it hits along its length and heals Illaoi if it hits at least one enemy champion.
* Awakening: The Tentacle awakens and remains active while Illaoi or a Vessel are within 2000 range and not dead. If none is nearby, the Tentacle finishes any of its ongoing attacks before becoming dormant.
* The Tentacle is lenient towards becoming dormant when Illaoi dies while the Tentacle is spawning or while she's pulling the Spirit.
* Enrage: The Tentacle is buffed by Leap of Faith.
* Vision: All Tentacles around 1000 range of an enemy champion are revealed through the fog of war.
* When about to slam it, reveals the targeted spot to allies.
* The Tentacle grants sight of nearby Control Wards.
* If Illaoi is in a different dimension than her Tentacles (i.e. Realm of Death), her Tentacles will continue to target units in their dimension only, but the area of damage will instead be dealt in Illaoi's dimension.

* Original: Illaoi’s powerful physique is dwarfed only by her indomitable faith. As the prophet of the Great Kraken, she uses a huge, golden idol to rip her foes’ spirits from their bodies and shatter their perception of reality.
