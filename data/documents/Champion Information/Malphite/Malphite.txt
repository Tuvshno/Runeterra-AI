A massive creature of living stone, Malphite was born from the heart of the great Ixtali construct known as the Monolith. He has studied the elemental balance of Runeterra for centuries, using his tremendous strength to maintain order in a frequently chaotic world, and crush the dark things that crawl beneath it. Now, roused all too often from his slumbers, Malphite endures the fluid temperaments of mortals, in pursuit of the only cause worthy of the last of his kind.

Malphite is a twenty-ton rock man who used to be part of an even larger rock that was destroyed, leaving him orphaned on a distinctly un-rocklike plane of existence. The guy could use a little luck.

“When I was young, I used to watch our ships sail back to port—but of late can't bring myself to look. For every vessel that docks, another runs aground of coral that was not there before. It's as though even the seabed has turned against us, slowly moving toward some unfathomable end.”

Designated M-2, the “Mecha Malphite” unit is a massive, bipedal fortress capable of turning into a planetary drill—making it the ultimate defensive option when faced with new and powerful kaiju. A single punch from its gauntlets can blow holes through thick titanium sheeting, and such attacks have felled countless monsters.

Their friendship ended in an instant, when one guardian's infinitesimal betrayal led to the death of another. Now, Malphite stands alone with unwavering loyalty, desperate to restore his nation's former glory, no matter the cost of lives.
