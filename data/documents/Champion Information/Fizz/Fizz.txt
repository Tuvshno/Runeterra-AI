Playful cannot be used for approximately 0.
5
seconds after using
Urchin Strike
.

Flash can be used while hopping off the trident but not while balanced on it.

If the first dash is interrupted, Fizz initiates the hop immediately, and if the second one is, the splash will not occur. In either cases, Fizz loses the untargetability.

If Playful is cast while under the effect of a move block, Fizz will not become untargetable and will initiate the hop instantly.

(bug)

If Trickster is cast, the splash will not occur.

(bug)

There is a minimum dash distance of 25 units for Playful.

If Fizz casts Playful on top of himself after being teleported (e.g. Flash, Recall), the minimum dash distance will not apply.

(bug)

The distance covered during Playful's directed splash is equal to half of Fizz's movement speed.

If Fizz enters stasis during either Playful or Trickster, the splash occurs after the stasis ends.

throws down a lure at the target location that attracts a shark, granting
sight
of the area before it emerges to chomp at the lure after 2 seconds, dealing
magic damage
to nearby enemies,
knocking them back
, though not through terrain, and
slowing
them for 2 seconds. The further the lure travels in its initial flight, the larger the shark that is attracted; increasing Chum the Waters'damage, slow, eruption radius and knock back distance.

**Gigalodon Damage:**

300 / 400 / 500

(+ 120% AP)

**Enemy champions**

can intercept the lure while it is in flight, which attaches to them upon contact and causes the shark to emerge at their position after the same delay. The lure's holder is
slowed
and
revealed
for the duration and afterwards is impacted by the eruption but is
knocked up
for 1 second instead of knocked back.

**Chum the Waters**

will cast at max range if cast beyond that.

**Lore**

Fizz is an amphibious yordle, who dwells among the reefs surrounding Bilgewater. He often retrieves and returns the tithes cast into the sea by superstitious captains, but even the saltiest of sailors know better than to cross him—for many are the tales of those who have underestimated this slippery character. Often mistaken for some manner of capricious ocean spirit, he seems able to command the beasts of the deep, and delights in confounding his allies and enemies alike.
