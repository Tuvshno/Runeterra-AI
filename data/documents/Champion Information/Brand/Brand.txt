Blaze

**EFFECT RADIUS:** 475

**Innate:**
Brand's abilities apply a stack of Ablaze to enemies hit for 4 seconds, stacking up to 3 times and refreshing the duration of all stacks with each application. Subsequent abilities used against a target with Ablaze are empowered. Killing an enemy afflicted with Ablaze or any enemy with an ability restores 30 - 50 (based on level) mana.

**Ablaze:****
While afflicted with Ablaze, the target is dealt magic damage equal to 2% of their maximum health over 4 seconds. 0.167% of their maximum health every 0.25 seconds over 4 seconds. Each stack of Ablaze deals damage to the target individually and applies their damage ticks dependent on the time they were applied, even if the duration of all the stacks are refreshed. Ablaze deals 215% damage per tick to monsters, capped at 80. Upon applying 3 stacks of Ablaze to a large monster or enemy champion, the fire becomes unstable, forming an area around the target that grants sight and explodes after 2 seconds, consuming all of their stacks. All enemies within the detonation are dealt magic damage equal to 9% - 13% (based on level) of their maximum health (+ 2% per 100 AP), reduced by 50% against epic monsters, and applied a stack of Ablaze.

The explosion will still occur if the target dies to the ability applying the third stack or during the delay. Brand cannot stack Ablaze more than once on enemies who have exploded in the last 4 seconds.

**Ablaze**
is a debuff that persists through death.

The explosion is not considered a tether effect and will not affect untargetable targets, even if the explosion originated from them.

Given the behavior of the stacking mechanic, the damage over time will deal varying amounts of damage based on the time the stacks were applied:

At sub-optimal applied times, 2 stacks will deal a minimum of 6% maximum health damage over 4 seconds, but will deal 7% maximum health at optimal applied times. Against small-medium units, 3 stacks will deal a minimum of 9% maximum health at sub-optimal times, but 11% maximum health at optimal times. If these stacks are further refreshed at optimal times, they can deal up to 12% maximum health over 4 seconds.

The burn is persistent damage and the explosion is area damage.
