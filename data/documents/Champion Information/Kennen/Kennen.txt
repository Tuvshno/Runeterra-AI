**Trivia**

* His dance references the Airflare, a breakdance move.
* He shares this dance with Camille.
* Her dance is very similar to PROJECT: Vayne's, whose dance is a similar breakdance move.
* Kennen used to gain the 'Law of Inverse Ninja Strength' cosmetic Easter egg debuff (This unit is a flippin' ninja! - This unit is more effective when they work alone. For every Ninja on your team beyond yourself, you lose 1 health.) when he, Akali, Shen, and/or Zed found themselves on the same team. It was removed in V3.14 for unknown reasons.
