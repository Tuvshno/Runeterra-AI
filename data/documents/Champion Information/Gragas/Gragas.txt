      **Trivia:**
      - Gragas is voiced by J.S. Gilbert.
      - Battlecast Prime Cho'Gath, Dr. Mundo, Corporate Mundo, pre-rework Sion, Udyr, and Spirit Guard Udyr are also voiced by the same voice actor.
      - Gragas used to be the only Mage/Fighter champion as well as the only melee mage.
      - He is now a Fighter/Mage, and until recently there have been no melee mages, with Sylas now taking up that role (even though most champions with the Mage secondary role are melee).
      - What appears to be Gragas' cask can be seen in the game's Mac Version trailer.
      - Gragas is the third champion to have 9 skins, behind Ryze and Annie.
