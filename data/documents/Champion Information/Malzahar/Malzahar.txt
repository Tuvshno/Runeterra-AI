##### Abilities

###### Void Shift

- **Passive:** Periodically, Malzahar gains Void Shift until he takes non-minion damage or negates a crowd control effect, to which it then lingers for 0.25 seconds before expiring.
- **Effect:** Malzahar gains crowd control immunity and 90% damage reduction while Void Shift is active.
- **Notes:**
  - Void Shift will not resist allied crowd control nor be deactivated by them.
  - Void Shift does not mitigate true damage but the buff will still be consumed.
  - Shields take priority over Void Shift, but the buff will still be consumed.
  - Void Shift triggers even if the shield negated the damage entirely.
  - If Malzahar has a spell shield and the shield fully mitigates the damage, Void Shift does not trigger.
  - The damage taken must be from an effect that cannot be negated by spell shields.
  - Spell shields take priority over Void Shift. If the triggering hostile ability does not contain a crowd control effect, both Void Shift and the spell shield break simultaneously.
  - Spell effects (i.e Wall of Pain) that cannot be blocked by spell shields ignore Void Shift despite its crowd control immunity.
  - Void Shift will specifically not deactivate if Malzahar eats Honeyfruit or is within a hostile Frozen Heart passive aura.
  - Void Shift will prevent Chum the Waters from attaching to him.

##### Trivia

[Malzahar Trivia](<URL>)

---

###### After the Battlemage update in V6.9, Malzahar's Voidlings had their color scheme changed from purple with yellow eyes to gray with purple eyes.

###### Malzahar is one of the few champions to have a pet, the others being Annie, Elise, Heimerdinger, Ivern, Shaco, and Yorick.

###### Malzahar and his Voidlings' dance references U Can't Touch This by MC Hammer.

###### A side-by-side comparison for Malzahar's part can be seen [here](<URL>).

###### A side-by-side comparison for his Voidlings' part can be seen [here](<URL>).

###### He shares this dance (specifically his Voidlings' part) with Jayce.

###### Upon the removal of Zz'Rot Portal in patch V9.23, Gathering Swarm stacks for Void Swarm was renamed to Zz'Rot Swarm to honor the item.

###### This might indirectly imply that Malzahar's voidlings are a similar if not the same species as the Voidspawn that spawned from that item.

###### Malzahar's Voidling had its assets reused for several rotating game modes.

###### It was given a retexture and features as a monster in Invasion.

###### Its animations were reused for the Cyte monster in Odyssey: Extraction.
