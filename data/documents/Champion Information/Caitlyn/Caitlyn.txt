					+ Headshot
						* SPEED: 3000
						* Innate: Caitlyn's basic attacks generate a stack of Count on-attack, doubled if she is within brush. At 5 stacks, or 4 while in brush, her next basic attack consumes all stacks on-attack to become a Headshot.
						* Headshot: Caitlyn's basic attack is empowered to have an uncancellable windup and deal 60 / 90 / 120% (based on level) (+148.75% + 42.5% critical strike chance) AD bonus physical damage, increased to 110 / 115 / 120% (based on level) (+148.75% + 42.5% critical strike chance) AD against non-champions. Enemies that step over a Yordle Snap Trap or are hit by 90 Caliber Net can grant an additional Headshot against them at 1300 range within 1.8 seconds, without consuming stacks. Each method grants only one Headshot at a time.

					* View in 3D
					* Renowned as its finest peacekeeper, Caitlyn is also Piltover’s best shot at ridding the city of its elusive criminal elements. She is often paired with Vi, acting as a cool counterpoint to her partner’s more impetuous nature. Even though she carries a one-of-a-kind hextech rifle, Caitlyn’s most powerful weapon is her superior intellect, allowing her to lay elaborate traps for any lawbreakers foolish enough to operate in the City of Progress.

					+ Ace in the Hole bug fix: Channel no longer improperly starts when feared during the cast time, thus refunding the ability's cooldown despite not being cancelled.
					+ Undocumented: The bonus range from Rapid Firecannon will not have any effect during trap and net extended Headshot attacks.
					+ Only the ordinary 100% attack damage portion of the attack can critically strike. The bonus from Headshot is added after the critical strike is rolled.
					+ The full damage of Headshot applies lifesteal.

					+ Since Caitlyn's Art and Sustainability Update, Ability-granted Headshots are the same as the original Headshot override attack, though what lets them cast at high range is still relatively special. They trigger on-attack effects (including stacking Headshot).
					+ Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury, is special cased to search targets with the increased range as well.
					+ Because Headshot stacks are generated on-attack, Runaan's Hurricane bolts will not generate stacks towards Headshot.
					+ The empowered attack will not trigger against wards.
					+ Stacks will still be generated towards Headshot when attacking them.
			- V11.24
				* General
					+ Base voice lines now play more consistently and accurately.

						- Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where she was able to Headshot enemies while being revived.

					+ Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where her recall would be interrupted if an enemy stepped on one of her traps.

					+ New splash artwork for Resistance Caitlyn, Sheriff Caitlyn, Safari Caitlyn, Arctic Warfare Caitlyn, and Officer Caitlyn.

					+ New lore.
					+ New voice-over.
					+ Added ejected bullet when reloading her rifle.

						- "Passive Ready" SFX adjusted for more of a Hextech feel. Added SFX that plays when Headshot is ready for use.
						- Piltover Peacemaker
							* New meshes and particles made to look more Hextech. Initial on-hit SFX are now more impactful than subsequent hits.

							* Added indicator on traps and their activation VFXs. Trap SFXs adjusted to match new animation timing.

							* New range indicator. On-hit SFX are now more impactful.

					+ Attack damage growth increased to 3.8 from 3.3.
					+ Attack speed growth increased to 4% from 3.5%.
			- V11.2
