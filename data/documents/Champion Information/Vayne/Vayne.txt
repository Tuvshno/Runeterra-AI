By fate, her narrow victory coincided with the turn of a new night, and the Midnight Dragon came down to imbue her spirit with blessed darkness, sharp as draconic scales.

- Added Trivia section.

Vayne is voiced by Nika Futterman. Vayne's dance references gun fu, also known as the Gun Kata. A side-by-side comparison can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_Mqlq-D870). Silver Bolts references werewolf fiction, possibly inspired by silver's & other heavy metals' antimicrobial properties. Vayne, Aatrox, and Viego are currently the only champions with an ability named the same as their title (Night Hunter, The Darkin Blade, and Blade of the Ruined King). As per her retconned lore, Vayne hunts and kills monsters, hybrids, shape-shifters, etc. not due to any ethical guidelines, but to satisfy her bloodlust, making her resemble Dexter Morgan, a fictional serial killer who mostly targets other morally deplorable murderers. Similarly, Vayne & Dexter both developed a killing urge after witnessing their respective parents being murdered (Vayne's father & mother; Dexter's mother). Vayne, Warwick, and Trundle are the only champions without damaging area-of-effect abilities. Vayne was nearly cancelled due to her concept artist unable to properly concept her with a big hat.
