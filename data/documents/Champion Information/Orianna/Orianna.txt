        *Innate - The Ball*
        
        Orianna is accompanied by The Ball, which she commands with her abilities.
        The Ball incurs a 0.01-second global cooldown on all of her abilities when she casts any ability. Additionally, The Ball attaches to Orianna if she is near it, and snaps back to her if she moves too far away from it, which incurs a 0.75-second cooldown on Command: Shockwave.
        Orianna's basic attacks generate a stack of Clockwork Winding for 4 seconds, refreshing on subsequent attacks and stacking up to 2 times. All stacks are lost when attacking a new enemy.
        *Clockwork Winding*
        
        Orianna's basic attacks are empowered to deal 10 − 50 (based on level) (+ 15% AP) bonus magic damage on-hit, increased by  «20%»  «2 - 10 (based on level) (+ 3% AP)» per stack, up to 14 − 70 (based on level) (+ 21% AP) total bonus magic damage.

          The Ball's stack count can be seen in Orianna's buff bar.
          The Ball will not incur its global cooldown from a Command: Protect cast that is used on a target already attached to it.
          The attacks do not deal the bonus damage against structures.
          Runaan's Hurricane's extra bolts will cause Clockwork Winding to reset its stacks, as she hits targets other than her latest one on-hit.

        Active: Orianna commands The Ball to fly to the target location and remain there, dealing magic damage to enemies it passes through and nearby enemies upon arrival, reduced to 70% against those hit beyond the first.
        Magic Damage: 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 (+ 50% AP)
        Reduced Damage: 42 / 63 / 84 / 105 / 126 (+ 35% AP)

          If The Ball is currently on Orianna, Command: Attack will have it cast to fly at least 150 units if the player attempts to cast it closer.
          The Ball does not grant sight while in flight, but the sound effect of striking an enemy is audible through the Fog of War.
          Orianna cannot use Command: Protect while The Ball is in transit with Command: Attack, but she may buffer Command: Dissonance and Command: Shockwave to cast once it has reached the location.
          The Ball will remain at the target location until Orianna retrieves it or if she goes beyond its leash range.
          Orianna will attempt to walk to Command: Attack's cast point if it lies outside cast range, and The Ball will never exceed its leash range regardless of target direction.
          PENDING FOR TEST: The Ball will drop to the ground upon colliding with Yasuo's Wind Wall, but not with Braum's Unbreakable.

        Active: Orianna commands The Ball to emit an electric pulse that deals magic damage to nearby enemies.
        Magic Damage: 70 / 120 / 170 / 220 / 270 (+ 70% AP)
        The pulse leaves behind an electric field that lasts 3 seconds, granting bonus movement speed to Orianna and her allies when they move within, and slowing enemies that move within the field by the same amount, decaying over 2 seconds after leaving.

          The Ball does not grant sight while in flight, but the sound effect of striking an enemy is audible through the Fog of War.
          Orianna cannot cast her other abilities while the The Ball is moving to the target with Command: Protect.
          Orianna gains Command: Protect's bonus resistances whenever The Ball is attached to her, even if she didn't self-cast.
          The Ball will remain where Command: Protect's target ally died, or, if they died or became untargetable before The Ball reaches them, it will instead snap back to Orianna.
          The Ball will join Command: Protect's target ally in stealth if they are affected by it when Orianna targets them.
          The Ball snaps back to Orianna upon being intercepted by projectile-blocking effects.
        
        **Command: Shockwave**
        
        *Cost*: 100 Mana

        *Cast time*: 0.5
        *Effect radius*: 415
        
        Active: Orianna commands The Ball to unleash a shockwave that deals magic damage to nearby enemies, stuns them for 0.75 seconds, and pulls them over 325 units, though not through terrain.
        Magic Damage: 250 / 400 / 550 (+ 95% AP)

          Cast VFX is now properly and consistently tracked in Fog of War, such as when cast on units that are moving very fast before entering vision.
          Command: Shockwave tosses enemies a set distance (those on the edge of the flinging area will be tossed to the center while those close to the middle will go over The Ball towards the edge), and can send them through walls.
          This ability will cast from wherever the unit the The Ball is attached to is at the end of the cast time, even if the unit exceeds max tether range.
          Displacement immunity will not resist the application of the stun.

        **General**
        An arrow will appear near Orianna whenever The Ball is not attached to her, pointing towards its location. The arrow will change colors depending on how far away The Ball and Orianna are from each other. If they are relatively near each other, the arrow is blue. If they are close to being outside of range of each other, the arrow is yellow (lime in colorblind mode). If it is very close, the arrow is red.

        Once a curious girl of flesh and blood, Orianna is now a technological marvel comprised entirely of clockwork. She became gravely ill after an accident in the lower districts of Zaun, and her failing body had to be replaced with exquisite artifice, piece by piece. Accompanied by an extraordinary brass sphere she built for companionship and protection, Orianna is now free to explore the wonders of Piltover, and beyond.

        A strange clockwork girl imbued with the magic of the Winterlands, Orianna once lived within a snowglobe created by a kindly old inventor. At the end of his life he freed her, and now she searches for greater purpose, serving in the court of the Poro King.

        When this robot girl wished upon the First Star, it granted her deepest desire: to become human. With that gift came all the responsibilities of a Star Guardian. Orianna analyzed the risks. Her chances of falling are… 1.3%. Of successfully blending in with high schoolers? The odds aren't looking great.

            Trivia
          [
        
        Orianna is a widespread Romance name, merged from two Latin roots with feminine suffix
        -na
        :
        Oriolar
        'I rise'; cf.
        Orientalis
        , referring the rising sun.
        Aurum
        '
        gold
        '; which she shares with
        Aurelion Sol
        .
        Orianna was the last champion priced lower than
        6300
        on release.
        Clockwork Winding
        is named after and references
        the eponymous gear mechanism
        .
        Orianna's icon during her 'Champion Spotlight' was a
        walfas-styled face.
        Multiple miniature copies of
        The Ball
        can be seen on
        Corporate Mundo's
        desk during the game's Mac Version trailer.
        In the now-removed official League of Legends
        forums
        , the
        icon
        of
        Command: Shockwave
        was used to represent the 'Forum Games' section.
