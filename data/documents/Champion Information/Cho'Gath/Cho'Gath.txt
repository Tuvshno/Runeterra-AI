        From the moment Cho’Gath first emerged into the harsh light of Runeterra’s sun, the beast was driven by the most pure and insatiable hunger. A perfect expression of the Void’s desire to consume all life, Cho’Gath’s complex biology quickly converts matter into new bodily growth—increasing its muscle mass and density, or hardening its outer carapace like organic diamond. When growing larger does not suit the Void-spawn’s needs, it vomits out the excess material as razor-sharp spines, leaving prey skewered and ready to feast upon later.

        Prior to indulging in the delectable taste of his victims, Cho'Gath prefers to invite them to his humble 40-acre mansion. There, he offers scones and jam, with a spot of tea… so his guests may savor their last meal before becoming one themselves.

        Citing nothing more than a blurry photograph, the locals in one isolated town insist on the existence of a large, predatory marine animal that grows in size every time it feeds. The reports are otherwise unsubstantiated, but the spike in tourism has been great for the local economy. Not the disappearances, though. Those are bad.

        A titanic beast feared for its massive size and endless appetite, no sane hunter would ever think of taking on Cho'Gath. Seeing as there are no sane hunters, Cho'Gath enjoys a steady supply of lightly armored food.

        A living weapon of Nocturne's design, Cho'Gath is meant to cleanse the world of the Neverghaast. Empowered by sacred artifacts from the congregation's crypts, it has remained dormant while Nocturne feeds it prisoners to build its power. Despite its maker's intentions, nothing will be able to sate the monster's hunger once it fully awakens.

        ****Trivia****
        [
        ]
        Cho'Gath is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect: Aurelion Sol , Bard , Bel'Veth , Draven , Kindred , Nasus , Senna , Shyvana , Sion , Smolder , Swain , Sylas , Thresh , and Veigar .
        In Cho'Gath's case, Feast infinitely stacks his health .
        Cho'Gath was the first champion to receive a second Legendary skin (though Corki has two 1820 skins both of which are Legacy and Tristana has also two 1820 skins although one is Legacy and the other one is available).
        Cho'Gath's dance references Fantasmic! by Mickey Mouse .
        Riot created an Adobe Flash minigame dedicated for him called Cho'Gath Eats the World for April Fools' Day 2013 .
        Another minigame released on the same date, Astro Teemo , which was unlocked by playing to a certain point in this game.
        The depiction of Cho'Gath in the icon of Feral Scream was based on his pose in his Original splash art .
        In the now-removed official League of Legends forums , the original icon of Feral Scream was used to represent the "General Discussion" section.
        In the official League of Legends game trailer from 2009, Cho'Gath was given generic T-Rex sounds.
        In the V1.0.0.115 April Fools' Day patch;
        The following changes regarding Cho'Gath were jokingly listed:
        Cho'Gath now starts the game the same size as if he had 6 feasts .
        Feast still increases Cho'Gath's size.
        Bushes can no longer stealth Cho'Gath.
        The following joke item was listed to be added:
        NEW Yordle Saddle: Any yordle champion can buy this new item to ride Cho'Gath.
        Cho'Gath was given a retexture and features as a monster called the "Big Stompy Monster" (along with its huge variant) in Invasion , a featured game mode .
