**Abilities**

**[** ]**

**Edit**

**Cosmic Creator**

**•**

* Innate: Aurelion Sol's damaging abilities against enemies generate him permanent stacks of Stardust, which gradually augments his abilities.

**Breath of Light**

**•**

* Cost: 15 / 17.5 / 20 / 22.5 / 25 Mana per 0.5 seconds
* Cooldown: 3 seconds
* Cast Time: none
* Range: 750 − 920 (based on level)
* Active: Aurelion Sol charges for up to 3.25 seconds to exhale a beam of starfire, during which he can steer the beam in the target direction. The beam collides with the first enemy hit to reveal them and deal magic damage every 0.125 seconds, reduced to 50% for other surrounding enemies hit by the beam.

**Magic Damage per Tick:** 5.625 / 7.5 / 9.375 / 11.25 / 13.125 (+ 6.875% AP)

**Reduced Damage per Tick:** 2.8125 / 3.75 / 4.6875 / 5.625 / 6.5625 (+ 3.4375% AP)

* The beam will deal a burst of bonus magic damage for each full second that it damages the same enemy, and generates 2 Stardust if the target is a champion. The damage based on the target's health ratio is capped at 300 against monsters.

**Bonus Magic Damage:** 55 / 65 / 75 / 85 / 95 (+ 30% AP)

**Recast:** Aurelion Sol ends Breath of Light early.

* At rank 5, Breath of Light's channel duration is increased to 160 seconds.
* Breath of Light cannot be cast for 1 second if the channel is cancelled within the first 0.25 seconds.

**Astral Flight**

**•**

* Cost: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 Mana
* Cooldown: 22 / 20.5 / 19 / 17.5 / 16 seconds
* Cast Time: 0.4 seconds
* Target Range: 1200 + 7.5 × Stardust
* Speeds: 335 + 100% movement speed / 167.5 + 50% movement speed
* Active: Aurelion Sol dashes in the target direction and resets Breath of Light's cooldown. While in flight, he has unobstructed vision and Breath of Light has no cooldown and maximum channel duration, but Astral Flight's dash speed is reduced by 50% during its channel.

**Breath of Light Flat Damage Modifier:** 108 / 109 / 110 / 111 / 112%

* Aurelion Sol will be knocked down by any immobilizing crowd control during the dash.
* Astral Flight can be recast after 0.5 seconds during the dash, and does so automatically upon arrival.

**Scoring a champion takedown within 3 seconds of damaging them reduces Astral Flight's current cooldown by 90% of its total cooldown.**

* Astral Flight cannot be used in the first 15 seconds of the game.

**Breath of Light's channel will be interrupted if Astral Flight ends or Singularity is cast during the flight, but the ability will automatically be cast afterwards.**

**Singularity**

**•**

* Cost: 80 / 85 / 90 / 95 / 100 Mana
* Cooldown: 12 seconds
* Cast Time: 0.25 seconds
* Target Range: 750 − 920 (based on level)
* Effect Radius: √(275² + 16.93² × Stardust) / √(137.5² + 8.46² × Stardust) / √(275² + 16.93² × Stardust) / √(137.5² + 8.46² × Stardust)
* Active: Aurelion Sol conjures a black hole at the target location after a 0.5-second delay that grants sight of the area and lasts for 5 seconds, dealing magic damage every 0.25 seconds to enemies within. Enemies in the black hole are dragged toward its center over the duration, and non-epic monster targets within the center that are below 5% (± 2.6%) of their maximum health are also executed. Additionally, non-champions affected have their movement speed reduced to 0.

**Magic Damage per Tick:** 2.5 / 3.75 / 5 / 6.25 / 7.5 (+ 5% AP)

**Total Magic Damage:** 50 / 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 (+ 100% AP)

**Map-Specific Differences**

* Singularity: On Howling Abyss, the cooldown is increased to 14 seconds.

* Cooldown: 120 / 110 / 100 seconds
* Cast Time: none
* Target Range: 1250
* Effect Radius: √(275² + 16.93² × Stardust)
* Active: Aurelion Sol calls down a star that strikes the target location after 1.25 seconds, dealing magic damage to enemies hit and stunning them for 1 second. This generates 5 Stardust for each enemy champion hit.

**Once Falling Star has been learned, gathering 75 Stardust causes the next cast of Falling Star to transform into The Skies Descend instead, empowering the impact with new effects.**

* Falling Star will cast at max range if cast within 200 units beyond that. During Astral Flight, it will do so at any range beyond the max.

**The Skies Descend**

**•**

* Cost: 100 Mana
* Cooldown: 120 / 110 / 100 seconds
* Cast Time: none
* Target Range: 1250
* Effect Radius: 5000
* Active: Aurelion Sol calls down a giant star that strikes the target location after 2 seconds, dealing 25% increased damage in a larger area and knocking up enemies hit for 1 second. Upon impact, a massive shockwave is unleashed which rapidly expands outward from the impact location over 3 seconds, dealing magic damage to enemy champions and epic monsters hit, slowing all enemies hit by 75% for 1 second, and revealing them for 1.5 seconds.

**Magic Damage:** 150 / 250 / 350 (+ 60% AP)

* The Skies Descend will cast at max range if cast within 200 units beyond that. During Astral Flight, it will do so at any range beyond the max.
* Enemies hit by the star are immune to the shockwave.

**Falling Star Details**

* Aurelion Sol will transform Falling Star into The Skies Descend each time he gathers 75 Stardust from the last time he used the empowered cast, or once he has gathered that amount after learning the ability.
* Stardust required for transformation is denoted by a progress bar over Falling Star in the HUD.
* Falling Star will impact immediately upon colliding with projectile-intercepting effects.

**Trivia**

[
]

Aurelion Sol is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect: Bard, Bel'Veth, Cho'Gath, Draven, Kindred, Nasus, Senna, Shyvana, Sion, Smolder, Swain, Sylas, Thresh, and Veigar. In Aurelion Sol's case, Stardust stacks gained through Cosmic Creator permanently increases Breath of Light's bonus magic damage, Astral Flight's range, Singularity's outer and inner radius and execution threshold, and Falling Star and The Skies Descend's effect radius.

The Skies Descend was named after his champion spell of the same name in Legends of Runeterra.

In 'Aurelion Sol: The Star Forger Returns' his hand gesture resembles the old Riot Games Inc. fist intro.

A lot of his animations and visual effects were inspired by celestial objects and atoms.

Aurelion Sol's lower body is not part of his in-game hitbox, which is why it is semi-transparent.

Prior to his CGU, in Ultra Rapid Fire his Center of the Universe passive used to have 6 stars orbiting around him with increased speed, simply by leveling up.

Interestingly, this is the only non-stat modification made to any champion in URF, suggesting this may have originally been an intended feature which was scrapped from the champion before release.

The name of the concept character from which Aurelion Sol spurred from, Ao Shin, could be a reference to Ao Qin, the Dragon King of the South Sea.
