    - **Abilities**
      * [ ]
      * **Death in Lavender**
        + Innate:
          - Bel'Veth attacks 36% faster than the median champion and her attack speed cap is modified to 90, but all sources of damage dealt by her basic attacks are reduced to 75%. Her attack speed does not increase through growth.
          - Innate: Bel'Veth's ability casts each generate 2 stacks of Death in Lavender, lasting for 5 seconds, refreshing on basic attacks and subsequent casts, and stacking up to 6 times. While Bel'Veth has stacks, she becomes ghosted and gains 20% − 40% (based on level) bonus attack speed. Her basic attacks each consume 1 stack.
          - Innate: Whenever Bel'Veth scores a takedown against a champion, monster, or minion within 3 seconds of damaging them, she generates a permanent stack of Lavender. Minions and monsters that are large generate 1 stack, champions and epic monsters generate 2 stacks.
        + Lavender: For each stack, Bel'Veth gains 0.28% − 1% (based on level) bonus attack speed.
      * Map-Specific Differences:
        + Howling Abyss: Bel'Veth gains 2 stacks from nearby siege minion deaths.
        + Arena: Differences: edit Bel'Veth gains 7.5 Lavender stacks per round.
      * **Void Surge**
        + COOLDOWN: 1, CAST TIME: None, RANGE: 400, COLLISION RADIUS: 100, SPEED: 800 / 850 / 900 / 950 / 1000 + 100% movement speed.
        + Per-Direction Cooldown: 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 seconds.
        + Active: Bel'Veth dashes in the designated direction, though not through terrain, dealing physical damage to enemies she passes through and applying on-hit effects at 75% effectiveness to the first target hit. Void Surge can critically strike for (75% + 50%) bonus physical damage against the first target and deals 140% damage to monsters and modified damage against minions.
      * **Above and Below**
        + COOLDOWN: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 seconds, CAST TIME: 0.5 seconds, RANGE: 0 - 660, WIDTH: 200.
        + Active: Bel'Veth slams her tail down in the target direction, dealing magic damage to enemies struck, knocking them up for 0.75 seconds, and slowing them by 50% for 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2 / 2.25 seconds. Hitting an enemy champion with Above and Below resets Void Surge's dash cooldown of the direction they were hit.

V13.4: Royal Maelstrom Bug Fix: Initial SFX no longer improperly plays for each hit of the ability.

Base health regeneration reduced to 6 from 8.5. Health regeneration growth reduced to 0.85 from 1.1.

Bonus attack speed per Lavender stack changed to 0.25% − 1.25% (based on level) from 0.25% − 1.25% (based on level). Void Surge Bug Fix: No longer triggers on-cast effects (e.g. Sheen) for casting the ability in a direction that isn't available while other dash directions are.

V12.11: Added Death in Lavender (Innate) Innate: After casting an ability, Bel'Veth gains 2 stacks for 5 seconds, stacking up to 6 times and refreshing on subsequent ability casts. While Bel'Veth has stacks, she becomes ghosted and gains 25% − 50% (based on level) bonus attack speed. Her basic attacks each consume 1 stack. Innate: Whenever Bel'Veth scores a takedown against a champion or monster within 3 seconds of damaging them, she gains stacks of Lavender permanently. Large monsters grant her 1 stack and champions and epic monsters grant her 2. Each stack grants her 0.25% − 1.25% (based on level) bonus attack speed. Bel'Veth can exceed the attack speed cap, but all sources of damage dealt or triggered by her basic attacks are reduced by 25%, including on-hit effects. She cannot gain attack speed through growth (per level). Void Surge (Q) Active: Bel'Veth dashes a fixed distance in a designated direction, though not through terrain, dealing 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 (+110% AD) physical damage to enemies she passes through and applying on-hit and spell effects at 75% effectiveness to the first target hit. Void Surge can critically strike for (75% + 50%) bonus physical damage. Void Surge deals 120% damage to monsters and 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100% damage against minions. Void Surge can only be cast in each of Bel'Veth's cardinal directions with a cooldown that incurs between casts. Each direction has a unique cooldown that is reduced equivalent to 0.25 ability haste per 1% bonus attack speed. These cooldowns reset upon respawning. Void Surge resets Bel'Veth's basic attack timer. Cooldown: 1 second. Per-Direction Cooldown: 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 seconds. Range: 400, Collision Radius: 100, Cast Time: None, Speed: 800 / 850 / 900 / 950 / 1000 + 100% movement speed. Above and Below (W) Active: Bel'Veth slams her tail down in the target direction, dealing 70 / 110 / 150 / 190 / 230 (+100% bonus AD) (+125% AP) magic damage to enemies struck, knocking them up for 0.75 seconds, and slowing them by 50% for 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2 / 2.25 seconds. Hitting an enemy champion with Above and Below resets Void Surge's dash cooldown of the direction they were hit. Cooldown: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 seconds. Range: 0 - 660, Width: 200, Cast Time: 0.5 seconds. Royal Maelstrom (E) Active: Bel'Veth rapidly slashes at the nearest enemy with the lowest current health percentage 6 (+1 per 33.3% bonus attack speed) times over 1.5 seconds, dealing 8 / 11 / 14 / 17 / 20 (+6% AD) physical damage with each slash, increased by 0% − 300% (based on target's missing health), and applying on-hit, on-attack, and spell effects at 6% − 24% (based on target's missing health) effectiveness. Royal Maelstrom deals 150% damage to monsters and its attacks apply life steal but cannot critically strike. Bel'Veth gains 70% damage reduction, 20 / 22 / 24 / 26 / 28% (+100% life steal) life steal, and is unable to move during Royal Maelstrom. She cannot perform slashes while unable to declare basic attacks. Royal Maelstrom can be recast after 0.75 seconds within the duration, and does so automatically afterwards or when Bel'Veth casts an ability. Recast: Bel'Veth ends Royal Maelstrom. Cooldown: 22 / 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 seconds. Effect Radius: 500, Cast Time: None. Endless Banquet (R) Passive: Bel'Veth's basic attacks on-hit apply a mark to the target for 5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent attacks and expiring upon attacking a new target. Every second attack on-hit against the marked target deals 6 / 8 / 10 (+12% bonus AD) bonus true damage and grants a stack that increases this damage by the same value. This effect stacks infinitely, but is capped at 5 stacks against epic monsters. Additionally, whenever Bel'Veth scores a takedown against a champion or epic monster while being alive, a Void Coral is spawned from their corpse for 15 seconds. Baron Nashor and Rift Herald summon an enhanced Void Coral. Active: Bel'Veth dashes to the target Void Coral and consumes it over the cast time, slowing nearby enemies by 25%, which ramps up to 99% over the duration, then creates an explosion that deals 150 / 200 / 250 (+100% AP) (+25 / 30 / 35% of target's missing health) true damage to them. Upon consumption, Bel'Veth also consumes all other existing Void Corpses, gains a stack of Lavender per Void Coral consumed, and assumes her True Form for 60 seconds. If Bel'Veth consumed at least one enhanced Void Coral, she gains an enhanced True Form that lasts 180 seconds and causes Void Remora to spawn from the deaths of nearby lane minions. Void Remora have 70% of the minion's maximum health and 110% of the minion's AD. A nearby Void Coral is required to cast this ability. True Form: Bel'Veth evolves into a monster, gaining 100 / 150 / 200 (+165% bonus AD) (+90% AP) bonus health, 25 / 50 / 75 bonus movement speed out-of-combat, 50 / 75 / 100 bonus attack range, as well as 10 / 15 / 20% increased total attack speed. She also gains the ability to dash through terrain with Void Surge. Consuming Void Corpses while in this state refreshes the duration of True Form and heals Bel'Veth for 100 / 150 / 200 (+165% bonus AD) (+90% AP). Cooldown: 1 second. Effect Radius: 500, Cast Time: 1 second. Trivia: Bel'Veth is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect: Aurelion Sol, Bard, Cho'Gath, Draven, Kindred, Nasus, Senna, Shyvana, Sion, Smolder, Swain, Sylas, Thresh, and Veigar. In Bel'Veth's case, Death in Lavender infinitely stacks the bonus attack speed gained from Lavender stacks and Endless Banquet infinitely stacks the bonus true damage dealt by the passive. If Bel'Veth has an attack speed of 1.8 or higher, her attack animations will change to thrust at the target instead of swiping at them.
