Runeterra Prime is an unofficial term that refers to the primary universe of the League of Legends intellectual property. Most stories and characters originate from this universe, and the wider community commonly refers to it as the "canon" lore.

Runeterra Prime currently consists of The Void and three realms of existence: Celestial (Targon Prime is located here), Spirit (Bandle City and Marus Omegnum are located here; the Death Realm is also part of it, including Mitna Rachnun), and Physical (the planet of Runeterra is located here). The Void is the unknowable nothingness outside of existence which interacts with it through the Watchers and Voidborn.

This universe has its own well-documented timeline of events separate from those of the Alternate Universes, which are commonly referred to as "skin" lore.
