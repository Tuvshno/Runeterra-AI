ACTIVE: Smolder spits a fireball at the target enemy that deals physical damage, increased by 0% − 30% (based on critical strike chance), and applies On-hit icon on-hit and on-attack effects at 100% effectiveness and Life steal icon life steal at 50% effectiveness.

Smolder Super Scorcher Breath 2
TIER 1 - 25 STACKS: The fireball explodes upon collision to deal the same physical damage to nearby enemies and apply On-hit icon on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness and Life steal icon life steal at 50% effectiveness.

Smolder Super Scorcher Breath 3
TIER 2 - 125 STACKS: The fireball sends forth 1 (+ 1.5 per 100 Dragon Practice Dragon Practice stacks) bolts of fire in an arc upon collision that explode at maximum range, dealing 75% of the same damage to enemies hit and applying On-hit icon on-hit effects at 75% effectiveness and Life steal icon life steal at 50% effectiveness.

11.25 / 18.75 / 26.25 / 33.75 / 41.25 (+ 75% AD) (+ 11.25% AP)

Smolder Super Scorcher Breath 4
TIER 3 - 225 STACKS: Enemies hit are set on fire for 3 seconds, causing them to take bonus true damage equal to「 2% per 100 bonus AD (+ 1% per 100 AP) (+ 0.8% per 100 Dragon Practice Dragon Practice stacks) of their maximum health over the duration, capped at 300 against monsters. 」Enemy Champion icon champions afflicted with the burn are also Death from Below executed once they are below 6.5% of their maximum health.

Super Scorcher Breath deals 110% damage against Minion icon minions and Monster icon monsters.

Applies Umbra Blades default damage for the burn, Disintegrate spell damage for the fireball, and Death Lotus area damage for the explosions.
Smolder can't declare basic attacks for a brief moment after the cast time.
Enemy champions that are burning will be executed as soon as they reach the health threshold; the burn does not need to damage them.
If Super Scorcher Breath would damage them to below the threshold, they are executed on the same damage instance.
Enemy champions will only be executed if Smolder damages them to below the threshold.
At 125 Dragon Practice Dragon Practice stacks, the fireball will launch 2 bolts.
At 225 Dragon Practice Dragon Practice stacks, the burn's damage based on the target's health ratio will increase by at least 1.8% and the execution threshold for the burn will be at least 7.625% of the target's maximum health.
Super Scorcher Breath can only hit enemies once per cast.
The minion and monster damage modifier applies only to the physical damage.
The bolts apply the bonus magic damage from Dragon Practice Dragon Practice at 75% damage.
This damage does not benefit from life steal.
Only Super Scorcher Breath's initial fireball missile can be Spirit's Refuge blocked and Jax Counter Strike old dodged.
The application of the burn is negated in both cases.
The fireball can still explode on-collision and fire the bolts in both cases.

Smolder Default Skin:
Hidden amongst the craggy cliffs of the Noxian frontier, under the watchful eyes of his mother, a young dragon is learning what it means to be heir to the Camavoran imperial dragon lineage. Playful and eager to grow up, Smolder looks for any excuse to practice his burgeoning abilities. Though he's still a fledgling, his skills are nothing to sneeze at, easily setting fire to anything that burns.
Voice Actor: Georgie Cordova Kidder
Splash Art Artist: Rudy Siswanto

Heavenscale Smolder Skin:
The youngest member of the royal family and cousin to the prince, Smolder likes nothing more than to tag along on any adventures Lee Sin gets up to. He may have missed the part of the plan that involves disguising himself as a human, but hey—he will show them that dragons don't need to dress up to be the life of the party!

Trivia
Smolder, the Fiery Fledgling Smolder, the Fiery Fledgling
Smolder's mom's roars are intelligible in draconic with certain translations provided by her writer, Kristina 'Goblin' Atanasoski.[2]
He refers to the Camavor Crest icon Kingdom of Camavor as Camaroar intentionally. This is most likely an artistic choice due to Camavor largely being influenced by dragons.
Smolder's mom's voice is a digital mix of various real animal voices. Certain sound effects for Smolder also incorporate some of these sounds.[3]
   "DUMB BULLFROG!" is Smolder's way of expressing frustration, like swearing.
   "HAVE NO FEAR, SMOLDER IS NEAR!" is a take on the cliché pop media catchphrase "Have no fear, (X character) is here!"
   "WELL, MY MOM WORKS FOR RIOT, AND SHE'S GONNA BAN YOU." breaks the fourth wall. It has a 1% chance of triggering when using his Taunt emote.
         -"MOM. MOM. MOOOM!" -(MOM ROARS.) -"HI!" is likely a reference to Family Guy.[4]
For every time Super Scorcher Breath's Super Scorcher Breath's execution sound effect triggers within approximately 5 seconds of the last, its pitch will be lower.
